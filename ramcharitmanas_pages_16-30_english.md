## Opening Prayers

The poet begins by honoring the gods, teachers, and divine beings who make all good things possible.

I bow to Saraswati, the goddess of speech, and to Ganesha, the elephant-headed god. They give us letters and meaning. They give us feeling and rhythm. They bring all good beginnings. Shloka 1

I bow to Shiva and Parvati. They are faith and trust in living form. Without these two, even the greatest seekers cannot see God in their own hearts. Shloka 2

I bow to my teacher, who is pure wisdom and forever true. He is like Shiva himself. Look at the moon - it is crooked and spotted. Long ago, the moon was cursed to fade away forever. He ran to Shiva for help, and Shiva placed him on his own head. Now the whole world worships that same flawed moon. When you have a great teacher, even your flaws become beautiful. Shloka 3

I bow to the first poet who wrote Rama's story and to Hanuman, the great monkey. Both are wise. Both are pure. Both love to walk through the garden of Sita and Rama's goodness. Shloka 4

> **Valmiki - The Robber Who Became the First Poet** — The first poet was once a highway robber named Ratnakar. One day he met some wandering sages who asked him a simple question: "Will your family share in the sins you commit for them?" When he asked, they all said no. This broke his heart open. The sages taught him to repeat Rama's name. He sat so still in meditation that an anthill grew over him. When he emerged, he was transformed - the robber had become the greatest poet. He wrote the original Ramayana in Sanskrit. Hanuman too gave his whole life to Rama - his devotion is legendary throughout the epic.

I bow to Sita, beloved of Rama. She creates, protects, and transforms everything. She takes away all suffering. She brings all good fortune. Shloka 5

The whole world dances under the spell of his magic - even the creator god and all the other gods and demons. Because of him, this world seems real, like mistaking a rope for a snake in dim light. His feet alone are the boat for those who want to cross the ocean of birth and death. I bow to that Lord, called Rama, who is the cause behind all causes and greater than everything. Shloka 6

What many holy books agree on, what the ancient Ramayana tells, and what I have gathered from other places too - I, Tulsidas, now weave together in beautiful simple language. I do this for the joy of my own heart. Shloka 7

## Calling on Ganesha and the Lord

The poet asks for blessings from those whose very remembrance brings success.

Think of him and every task succeeds. He is the lord of all good spirits. He has the face of a noble elephant. He is a treasure of wisdom and a home for good qualities. May that Ganesha bless me. Soratha 1

His grace can make a silent person speak beautifully. His grace can help a lame person climb the highest mountain. He burns away all the troubles of this dark age. May that kind one look at me with love. Soratha 2

His body is dark blue like a fresh lotus. His eyes are like red lotuses in full bloom. He rests forever on the ocean of milk. May that Lord make his home in my heart. Soratha 3

> **The Churning of the Ocean of Milk** — In the ancient stories, there is a vast white ocean made of milk at the edge of the world. There, the great serpent with a thousand heads floats on the waters, and Vishnu lies peacefully on that serpent's coils. Once, the gods and demons wanted the nectar of immortality, which was hidden deep in this ocean. So they worked together to churn it, using a mountain as the churning rod and a great serpent as the rope. But as soon as they began, the mountain started sinking into the ocean floor. Everything would have been lost. So Vishnu dove beneath the waters and took the form of a giant tortoise. He placed the mountain on his back and held it steady. With Vishnu supporting them from below, the gods and demons churned for ages. Many wonders rose up from the waters - the moon, a magical tree, a divine cow, and the goddess of wealth. But a terrible poison also came up, so strong it could destroy everything. Shiva drank that poison to save the world, and it turned his throat blue. Finally the nectar appeared, and the gods claimed it. Through all this, Vishnu watched and helped from his home on those milky waters. He still rests there, calm and eternal, while the universe moves around him.

His body is white like jasmine flowers and the moon. He is Parvati's beloved and an ocean of kindness. He loves those who have nothing. May he be kind to me. Soratha 4

> **Shiva Burns the God of Love** — Once, the god of love tried to disturb Shiva's meditation by shooting flower arrows at him. Shiva opened his third eye and burned him to ash. Yet that same fierce Shiva is full of tenderness for the humble. This story shows how the destroyer of desire can also be an ocean of compassion.

I bow at the lotus feet of my teacher. He is an ocean of grace. He is God himself in human form. His words are like rays of sunlight that scatter the thick darkness of ignorance. Soratha 5

## Praise of the Teacher

Tulsidas speaks of the transforming power of a true teacher's grace.

I bow to the dust of my teacher's feet. It has a lovely taste, a sweet fragrance, and is full of devotion. It is like a beautiful powder made from the root of immortality. It destroys the whole family of worldly diseases. Chaupai 1

That dust is like the sacred ash on Shiva's body - worn by those who have earned good fortune. It gives birth to beauty, blessing, and joy. It removes the dirt from the mirror of a devotee's mind. When applied as a mark on the forehead, it brings all good qualities under your influence. Chaupai 2

The light from my teacher's toenails shines like gems. When you remember it, divine sight awakens in your heart. That light destroys the darkness of ignorance. Whoever receives it in their heart is truly fortunate. Chaupai 3

When that light enters, the pure eyes of the heart open. The sorrows and faults of this night-like world disappear. Then you begin to see the jewels of Rama's story everywhere - some hidden, some open, each in its own mine. Chaupai 4

It is like applying a magic ointment to your eyes. The dust from a true teacher's feet works like this ointment. It opens your inner eye. Suddenly you see the hidden wealth of Rama's story all around you - what was always there but invisible before. Doha 1

> **Concept Explained:**
>
> **Siddhanjanam - The Magic Eye Ointment** — In the old stories, there was a special paste called siddhanjanam. If you rubbed it on your eyelids, you could suddenly see what was always hidden - buried gold beneath the earth, gems inside mountains, treasures that others walked over without knowing. Seekers and wise ones used this ointment and saw riches everywhere. Tulsidas uses this as a metaphor: the dust from a true teacher's feet works the same way, revealing the spiritual treasures hidden in plain sight.

The dust of my teacher's feet is a soft and lovely ointment for the eyes - nectar that destroys all defects of vision. Using it, I clean the eyes of wisdom. Then I tell Rama's story, which frees us from the world's chains. Chaupai 5

## Honoring the Holy and the Good

The poet bows to the learned and to saints, explaining their quiet power.

First I bow at the feet of the learned ones, the gods of the earth. They remove all doubts born of confusion. Then with loving words I bow to the community of good people, who are a mine of all virtues. Chaupai 6

A saint's life is like a cotton plant. Think about cotton. Its fruit has no sweet juice to offer. It looks plain and white, nothing special. But inside it is full of soft, useful threads. And what do we do with those threads? We spin them into cloth that covers people's bodies and hides their nakedness. The cotton plant gives up its own comfort so others can be covered. A saint is just like this. He lives a simple life without pleasures. He bears troubles quietly. And when he sees someone's faults or shame, he covers them up instead of exposing them. He protects people's dignity the way cloth protects the body. This is why the world respects him so deeply. Chaupai 7

The gathering of saints is full of joy and blessing. It is like a walking holy pilgrimage site. In it, devotion to Rama flows like the sacred Ganga river. Thinking deeply about truth flows like another holy river. Chaupai 8

The stories of what to do and what not to do flow like the river that washes away sins. The tales of Vishnu and Shiva sit beautifully together like three rivers meeting. Hearing them gives all happiness and good fortune. Chaupai 9

Steady faith in one's own duty is like the undying banyan tree at that holy place. Good actions are its surroundings. This sacred gathering of saints can be found in any country, at any time, by anyone. When served with respect, it destroys all sorrows. Chaupai 10

This holy place is beyond words, beyond this world. Its power shows itself right away. Chaupai 11

Those who hear and understand its glory with a happy heart, who bathe in it with great love - they gain all four rewards of life even while still alive: purpose, prosperity, pleasure, and freedom. Doha 2

## The Power of Good Company

Tulsidas explains how being around the right people can transform anyone.

See the results of bathing there right away. Crows become cuckoos. Herons become swans. Hear this and do not be surprised. The glory of good company is no secret. Chaupai 12

The first poet, the wandering saint, and the wise hermit have each told their own story through their own lips. Think of all living beings in water, on land, in the sky - all the conscious and unconscious creatures in this world. Chaupai 13

Whenever any of them gained wisdom, fame, a good path, prosperity, or goodness - however they got it, wherever they got it - know that it came from the power of good company. In the scriptures and in life, there is no other way. Chaupai 14

Without good company, wisdom does not arise. Without Rama's grace, good company is hard to find. Good company is the root of all joy and blessing. Getting that company is the fruit. All other efforts are just flowers. Chaupai 15

Wicked people become good through good company, just as iron becomes gold by touching the philosopher's stone. But if by some twist of fate a good person falls into bad company, he still follows his own nature - like the gem in a serpent's hood. Though it lives with the poisonous snake, the jewel keeps its light and does not absorb the poison. Chaupai 16

Even the creator god, Vishnu, Shiva, poets, and scholars hesitate when speaking of the greatness of saints. How can I describe it? I am like a vegetable seller trying to talk about the qualities of precious gems. Chaupai 17

I bow to the saints, whose minds are balanced. They have no friend or enemy. They are like beautiful flowers held in cupped hands. The hand that plucked the flower and the hand that holds it both receive the same sweet fragrance. So too, saints bless everyone equally - those who hurt them and those who help them. Doha 3a

Saints have simple hearts. They care for the world's good. Knowing their nature and their love, I make this request: please hear my humble words and be kind. Give me love for Rama's feet. Doha 3b

## On Bad People

A surprisingly honest look at those who cause harm. Tulsidas bows even to them - partly out of humility, partly with sharp wit.

Now I bow with a true heart even to wicked people. They work against even those who help them, for no reason at all. They see profit only in harming others. They are happy when others fail and sad when others do well. Chaupai 18

They try to block the good name of God, just like the eclipse demon tries to swallow the full moon. Bad people are great warriors when it comes to ruining others. They look for people's faults with a thousand eyes. Their minds are like flies near good food - the fly lands in clarified butter, spoils it, and dies itself. Wicked people destroy others' good work and hurt themselves in the process. Chaupai 19

> **Story Referenced:**
>
> **Rahu - The Eclipse Demon** — During the churning of the ocean of milk, the nectar of immortality finally appeared. The gods lined up to drink it. But one clever demon disguised himself and sneaked into their line. He was about to drink when the sun and moon recognized him and called out to Vishnu. Vishnu spun his discus and cut off the demon's head. But it was too late - the nectar had already touched his lips. So now his head is immortal, floating angrily through the sky forever. To this day, that head chases the sun and moon to take revenge on them for exposing him. When he catches them, he swallows them - this is what we call an eclipse. But since he has no body, they slip out from his neck and shine again.

In their burning heat they are like fire. In their anger they are like the god of death. In hoarding sins and faults they are as rich as the god of wealth. Their rise is like a comet - it signals trouble for everyone. It is best when they sleep deeply like a certain demon who slept for six months at a time. Some people are like this. Their sleeping is a blessing for everyone. Chaupai 20

> **Story Referenced:**
>
> **Kumbhakarna - The Sleeping Giant** — Kumbhakarna was the brother of Ravana, the ten-headed king. He performed intense prayers and earned a wish from the creator god. He meant to ask for "Indra's throne" (Indrasana) so he could rule the heavens. But the goddess of learning twisted his tongue at the last moment. Instead of "Indrasana" he said "Nidrasana" - a seat of sleep. The creator god granted it, and the demon was doomed to sleep for six months at a time. He was a terrifying warrior - but only when awake. The world was safer when he slept.

They would give up their own bodies to ruin someone else, like hailstones that destroy crops and then melt away. I bow to such wicked people as if they were the thousand-headed serpent - they use a thousand mouths to angrily describe the faults of others. Chaupai 21

Again I bow to them as if to an ancient king who wished for ten thousand ears - they use ten thousand ears to hear about other people's sins. I salute them like Indra, the king of gods. Chaupai 22

> **Wordplay Explained:**
>
> **Suranik - Army of Gods or Lovers of Wine?** — Tulsidas makes a joke here using the word "suranik." When you say it about Indra, it means "army of gods" - the noble warriors who protect heaven and fight for good. When you say it about wicked people, the same sound means "wine is dear" - they just love to drink. Same word, two meanings. Indra leads divine armies into righteous battle. These people stumble into fights because they are drunk.

Harsh words are their favorite weapon. With a thousand eyes they search for others' flaws. Chaupai 23

This is the way of wicked people: they burn with jealousy when they hear of anyone's good fortune - whether stranger, enemy, or friend. Knowing this, I fold both my hands and humbly request them with love. Doha 4

I have done my part by asking politely. But they will never change their ways. You may raise crows with great affection. Will they ever stop eating flesh? Chaupai 24

## Saints and Sinners Compared

Tulsidas explores what makes the good different from the bad - both born in the same world.

Now I bow to the feet of both saints and sinners. Both give pain, but there is a difference. One causes pain when you must part from them. The other causes pain just by meeting them. Chaupai 25

Both are born together in this world. But like the lotus and the leech born in the same water, their qualities are different. The lotus delights the eye and is soft to touch. The leech clings and drinks your blood. Saints are like nectar - they free you from death. Sinners are like wine - they bring confusion and dullness. Both come from the same deep ocean of the world. Chaupai 26

Good and bad earn their own rewards through their own deeds - one gains a good name, the other shame. Nectar, the moon, the Ganga, and saints belong together. Poison, fire, the river of sin, and hunters belong together. Everyone knows the difference between these. But people love what suits their taste. Chaupai 27

A good person chooses goodness. A low person clings to lowness. Nectar is praised for giving life. Poison is praised for bringing death. Doha 5

## Why the Poet Speaks of Both

A reason for naming both good and bad qualities.

The sins of the wicked and the virtues of the good - both are like endless, bottomless oceans. That is why I have described some qualities and some faults. Without knowing them, how can one choose what to hold and what to leave? Chaupai 28

The creator made both good and bad. The scriptures separated them by counting their qualities and faults. The holy books say this creation is mixed with both. Chaupai 29

Pain and pleasure, sin and virtue, day and night. Saints and sinners, noble birth and low birth. Demons and gods, high and low. Nectar and poison, life and death. Illusion and truth, the soul and the Lord. Wealth and poverty, the beggar and the king. The holiest city and an unholy land. The sacred Ganga and a river of sin. A great desert and a rich green country. A holy priest and a cruel butcher. Heaven and hell, attachment and freedom. The scriptures have divided them all by their qualities and faults. Chaupai 30-32

The creator made this world of matter and mind full of good and bad. Saints are like swans. A swan can separate milk from water when they are mixed - it drinks the milk and leaves the water. Saints take the good and leave the bad. Doha 6

## Bowing to All Creation

The poet humbles himself before every living being, seeing Rama in all.

When the creator gives this kind of swan-like wisdom, the mind leaves faults behind and becomes devoted to virtues. But because of time, nature, and the force of past actions, even good people sometimes slip from goodness when caught by illusion. Chaupai 33

Those devoted to God quickly correct their mistakes. They crush sorrow and fault and spread pure fame. Even wicked people sometimes do good when they find good company. But their deeply stained nature does not go away. Chaupai 34

Some imposters dress like holy men, and the world honors them for their appearance. But in the end they are exposed. Their deceit does not last, just as the trickery of certain demons did not last. Chaupai 35

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Kalanemi - The False Sage** — Rama's brother lay dying on the battlefield, struck by a terrible weapon. Only a rare herb from a distant mountain could save him, and it had to arrive before dawn. Hanuman flew through the night sky to fetch it. The ten-headed king grew desperate - if the brother was healed, his army would be finished. So he sent a demon named Kalanemi to stop Hanuman. This demon disguised himself as a peaceful sage sitting by a lake. When Hanuman landed to ask for directions, the fake sage said, "Rest here, drink some water, let me help you." It was a trap. But Hanuman sensed something wrong. He grabbed the demon and saw through the disguise. With one blow, he killed the imposter and flew on. The herb arrived in time. The brother was saved. The lesson: wear a holy man's clothes all you want, but truth has a way of tearing off masks.
>
> **2. Ravana and Rahu** — The ten-headed king and the eclipse demon also tried their tricks through disguise and deception. All were defeated in the end. Evil cannot hide forever behind a mask of goodness.

Even with a rough appearance, a true saint is honored, just as the old bear king Jambavan and Hanuman are honored in the world. The loss from bad company and the gain from good company are known everywhere - in daily life and in the scriptures. Chaupai 36

> **Story Referenced:**
>
> **Jambavan - The Ancient Bear** — Jambavan was ancient beyond measure - he had circled the creator god seven times when the universe was still young, and he remembered things from before most gods were born. By the time of Rama's story, he was gray and slow, his body worn down by age. He looked like a tired old bear, nothing more. But inside him was wisdom from the beginning of time. When Rama's army lost hope, it was this old bear who remembered that Hanuman had powers he had forgotten. "You can leap across the ocean," he told Hanuman. "You just don't remember what you are." And Hanuman flew. The roughest looking one in the army carried the deepest knowing. That is why the world honors him.

Dust rises to the sky in the company of wind. The same dust becomes mud in the company of water flowing low. A parrot in a saint's house learns to say "Rama, Rama." A parrot in a sinner's house learns to curse. Chaupai 37

In bad company, smoke becomes black soot. In good company, that same smoke becomes ink for writing holy books. When smoke joins water, fire, and wind, it becomes a rain cloud that gives life to the world. Chaupai 38

Planets, medicines, water, wind, and cloth - all become harmful or helpful depending on their association. Thoughtful people understand this. Doha 7a

The bright half and dark half of the moon have the same amount of light. But people named them differently. One is called the moon's growth, the other its fading. One gets praise, the other blame. Doha 7b

All beings in the world - still or moving - I know them all to be filled with Rama. With folded hands, I bow to the feet of all. Doha 7c

Gods, demons, humans, serpents, birds, ghosts, ancestors, heavenly musicians, and spirits of the night - I bow to you all. Please be kind to me now. Doha 7d

Beings born from sweat, eggs, earth, and womb - all eighty-four hundred thousand kinds living in water, on land, and in the sky - I see them all as Sita and Rama. With folded hands I bow to them. Chaupai 39

Knowing me as your servant, you who are oceans of kindness - please be gracious to me. Drop all pretense and show me love. I have no confidence in my own strength or mind. That is why I ask everyone. Chaupai 40

## The Poet's Humility

Tulsidas admits his own weakness but reveals his one great hope.

I wish to sing the story of Rama. But my mind is small and his story is an ocean without end. I cannot think of even one way forward. My mind and thoughts are beggars. My desire is a king. Chaupai 41

My ability is very low, but my wish is very high. I long for nectar, but I cannot even find buttermilk in this world. Good people will forgive my boldness. Like parents enjoying a child's babbling, they will listen with affection. Chaupai 42

When a small child speaks in broken sounds, father and mother listen with delighted hearts. But the cruel and crooked will laugh - those who wear others' faults like ornaments. Chaupai 43

Who does not like their own poems - whether sweet or flat? But rare are the noble souls who feel joy when hearing someone else's words. Chaupai 44

Most people in this world are like ponds and rivers. They swell only with their own rising waters. A true saint is rare like the ocean. When the ocean sees the full moon, it rises with joy. The moon is not part of the ocean, yet the ocean celebrates its fullness. Chaupai 45

My fortune is small, my desire is great. But I have one faith: all good people will find joy in hearing this, and wicked people will laugh. Doha 8

Let the wicked laugh. Even their laughter helps me. Crows call the sweet-voiced cuckoo harsh. Herons laugh at swans. Frogs laugh at the rainbird who drinks only pure drops from the sky. The impure always mock what is pure. Chaupai 46

Those who have no love for poetry and no feeling for Rama's feet - this story will taste flat to them. But for those who love the feet of Vishnu and Shiva, who do not argue about which is higher - for them this story will be sweet. Chaupai 47

Good people know that this story is adorned with devotion to Rama. They will listen and speak well of it. I am no poet. I have no skill with words. I lack all arts and learning. Chaupai 48

There are many kinds of letters, meanings, and decorations in poetry. There are many forms of verse and composition. There are endless types of moods and feelings. Poetry has countless merits and faults. Chaupai 49

I do not have even one understanding of these things. I write this on blank paper as honest truth. Chaupai 50

## The Glory of Rama's Name

The poet reveals the one jewel that makes everything shine.

My poetry lacks all merit. But there is one quality known throughout the world. Thinking of that, wise people with clear understanding will listen. Doha 9

In this poetry is the generous name of Rama. That name is the purest essence of all scriptures. It is the home of all blessings and the remover of all misfortune. Shiva himself, together with Parvati, always chants it. Chaupai 51

Even wonderful poetry by a great poet does not shine without Rama's name. A beautiful moon-faced woman, dressed in every ornament, still needs clothes to look complete. Chaupai 52

On the other hand, even poor verses by a weak poet, if marked with Rama's name and glory, are spoken and heard with respect by the wise. Saints are like bees - they seek only the essence of goodness. Chaupai 53

Though my poetry has no flavor, the power of Rama shines through it. This is my only confidence. Who has not gained greatness through good company? Chaupai 54

Even smoke gives up its natural bitterness when it joins the fragrant aloewood, and becomes sweet-smelling. My style may be rough, but I describe something beautiful: the story of Rama, which brings blessing to the world. Chaupai 55

This story of Rama brings blessing and removes the stains of this dark age. The flow of this poor poetry is crooked, like the flow of a sacred river - but the water is pure. Through the company of Rama's glory, these verses will become beautiful and pleasing to good hearts. Even the ash of a cremation ground becomes lovely and sacred when it rests on Shiva's body. Chhand

Because of its connection to Rama's glory, my poetry will become dear to everyone. Sandalwood trees grow on a certain mountain. Any ordinary wood that grows there also becomes fragrant and worthy of worship. Does anyone then care that it was just common wood? Doha 10a

A black cow gives bright white milk, full of goodness. Knowing this, everyone drinks it. In the same way, though my language is rough and rural, wise people will happily sing and hear the glory of Sita and Rama. Doha 10b

## Poetry Finds Its Glory in God

Tulsidas reflects on how gems find their glory in the right setting, and how poetry finds its glory when it speaks of God.

Gems and pearls have great beauty. But they do not shine on the head of a snake or an elephant or a mountain. They shine best on a king's crown or a young woman's body. The right setting brings out their full glory. Chaupai 1

Good poetry is the same way. It is born in one place and finds its beauty in another. A poem shines when people receive it, discuss it, and follow the ideals it speaks of. When a poet with true devotion remembers Saraswati, she leaves even the creator god's home and comes running to help. Chaupai 2

But her tiredness from running so far cannot be healed by any ordinary remedy. Only a bath in the lake of Rama's story can refresh her. Knowing this, wise poets sing the glory of God. His story washes away all the troubles of this dark age. Chaupai 3

When someone uses Saraswati's gift to praise ordinary worldly people, she beats her head in regret. She thinks, "Why did I come when this person called?" Wise people say the heart is like the ocean. The mind is like an oyster shell. Saraswati is like the Swati star. Chaupai 4

> **Concept Explained:**
>
> **The Pearl and the Swati Star** — In India there is a belief that when the Swati star appears in the sky during monsoon season, if a single raindrop falls into an open oyster shell, it becomes a pearl. Tulsidas uses this as a metaphor for how poetry is born: the heart is the ocean, the mind is the oyster shell, and divine inspiration (Saraswati) is like the Swati star. When good thoughts rain down like water from that star, beautiful poetry forms like pearls in the shell of the mind.

When good thoughts rain down like water from that star, beautiful poetry forms like pearls in the shell of the mind. Chaupai 5

These pearl-poems are then strung together with skill on the beautiful thread of Rama's story. Good people wear this necklace on their pure hearts. It fills them with deep love. Doha 11
