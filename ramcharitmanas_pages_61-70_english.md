## The Lake of Rama's Story
The poet describes those who fail to drink from this holy lake, and those blessed enough to bathe in it.

Even if someone struggles hard and reaches this lake, as soon as they arrive, a sleepy fever takes over. A bitter cold of foolishness grips their heart. Even after reaching there, the unlucky one cannot bathe. Chaupai 1

Such a person cannot bathe in the lake or drink its water. He returns home full of pride. When others ask him about the lake, he hides his own misfortune. Instead, he criticizes the lake to explain himself. Chaupai 2

No obstacles can touch the one whom Rama looks upon with his beautiful, gracious gaze. That person alone bathes in this lake with reverence. He is never burned by the three great sufferings of life. These are the troubles that come from within ourselves, from nature and fate, and from other living beings. Chaupai 3

Those who have true love for Rama's feet never leave this lake. O brother! If you wish to bathe in this lake, keep the company of good people with all your heart. Chaupai 4

## The Poet's Joy
Tulsidas describes how seeing this lake filled him with delight, and how the river of poetry began to flow.

When the poet looked at this lake of Rama's story with the eyes of his heart and took a dip in it, his mind became pure. His heart filled with joy and enthusiasm. A flood of love and happiness rushed through him. Chaupai 5

From this lake flowed a beautiful river of poetry, filled with the pure water of Rama's glory. This river is called Sarayu. It is the root of all beautiful blessings. The views of the common people and the views of the scriptures are its two lovely banks. Chaupai 6

This Sarayu is the daughter of the beautiful lake of Rama's story. It is very holy. It uproots the small and large sins of this dark age, pulling them out like grass and trees torn from their roots. Chaupai 7

## The River of Rama's Fame
The poet extends the river metaphor to describe the listeners, the assembly of saints, and how devotion flows to the ocean of God.

The three kinds of listeners are the towns, villages, and cities settled on both banks of this river. The assembly of saints is like the peerless city of Ayodhya, the root of all beautiful blessings. Doha 39

The lovely river of Rama's fame joins the Ganga of devotion to Rama. The holy glory of Rama's battle with his younger brother Lakshmana joins it like the beautiful great river Sone. Chaupai 1

Between these two rivers flows the stream of devotion like the Ganga, shining with wisdom and detachment. This confluence of three rivers frightens away the three kinds of suffering. It flows toward the ocean that is Rama himself. Chaupai 2

The source of this river of fame is Rama's story. It has joined the Ganga of devotion. Therefore, it will purify the minds of good people who listen to it. The various wonderful stories woven through it are like the forests and gardens along the riverbanks. Chaupai 3

The countless wedding guests at Shiva and Parvati's marriage are the many kinds of water creatures in this river. The joyful songs celebrating Rama's birth are the charming whirlpools and waves of this river. Chaupai 4

The childhood adventures of the four brothers are the many colorful lotuses blooming in this river. The good deeds of King Dasharatha, his queens, and their family are the bees and water birds. Doha 40

## Episodes as Parts of the River
The poet continues describing how different parts of Rama's story become elements of the sacred river.

The beautiful story of Sita's wedding ceremony spreads its lovely charm through this river. The many thoughtful questions are the boats on this river. The wise answers are the skilled boatmen. Chaupai 1

The discussions that happen after hearing this story are like groups of travelers walking along the river shores. The warrior-sage who once killed many kings in anger, his fury is the dangerous current of this river. Rama's noble words are the well-built bathing spots. Chaupai 2

The joy of Rama's wedding with his brothers is the blessed flood of this story-river. It gives happiness to everyone. Those who feel delight and their hair stands on end when telling or hearing this story are the truly blessed ones. They bathe in this river with glad hearts. Chaupai 3

The festive preparations for crowning Rama as king are like pilgrims gathering at the river during a festival. The wicked thinking of Kaikeyi, who was one of Rama's stepmothers, is the moss in this river. As a result of her scheming, great misfortune fell upon everyone. Chaupai 4

Bharata's noble character calms all the countless troubles. It is like the prayers and rituals performed on the riverbank. The mentions of the sins of this dark age and the faults of wicked people are the mud, cranes, and crows of this river. Doha 41

## The Six Seasons in the River
Tulsidas maps the six seasons of India onto different parts of Rama's story.

This river of fame is beautiful in all six seasons. It is always lovely and extremely pure. The wedding of Shiva and Parvati is the early winter season. The celebration of Rama's birth is the pleasant late winter season. Chaupai 1

The description of Rama's wedding ceremony is the joyful and blessed spring, the king of seasons. Rama's journey to the forest is the unbearable summer. The story of his travels is the harsh sun and hot winds. Chaupai 2

The fierce battle with the demons is the rainy season. It brings beautiful blessings for the gods, like rain brings blessings for rice crops. The happiness, humility, and glory of Rama's kingdom is the pleasant, clear autumn season. Chaupai 3

The stories of Sita's virtues, the crown jewel among faithful wives, are the pure and matchless quality of this water. Bharata's nature is the beautiful coolness of this river. It stays the same always and cannot be fully described. Chaupai 4

The four brothers looking at each other, talking, meeting, their mutual love, their laughter, and their beautiful brotherhood are the sweetness and fragrance of this water. Doha 42

## The Miraculous Water
The poet describes how this water heals the heart and warns against ignoring it.

My longing, my humility, and my lowliness are the lightness of this beautiful, pure water. Indeed, it is extremely light. This water is truly wondrous. Simply hearing it does good to you. It removes the thirst of desire and washes away the dirt from the mind. Chaupai 1

This water nourishes beautiful love for Rama. It takes away all the sins and the shame of this dark age. It dries up the weariness of worldly life. It satisfies even those who are already content. It destroys sins, sorrows, poverty, and faults. Chaupai 2

This water destroys desire, anger, pride, and attachment. It increases pure wisdom and detachment. By bathing in it with reverence and drinking it, all the sins and sorrows dwelling in the heart are removed. Chaupai 3

Those cowards who did not wash their hearts with this water of Rama's glory were cheated by this dark age. Like a thirsty deer that sees sunlight shimmering on sand and mistakes it for real water, they run toward it and find nothing. They remain unhappy, wandering after worldly pleasures. Chaupai 4

## The Beginning of the Story
The poet prepares to tell the dialogue between two great sages, and describes the sacred gathering at Prayag.

According to my understanding, I have considered the qualities of this beautiful water and bathed my mind in it. Remembering Parvati and Shiva, this poet Tulsidas now tells the beautiful story. Doha 43a

Now, holding the lotus feet of Rama in my heart and receiving his grace, I will describe the beautiful dialogue between two great sages who met long ago. Doha 43b

The sage Bharadwaja lives in Prayag, the holiest place where three sacred rivers meet. He has deep love for Rama's feet. He is an ascetic with a controlled mind and conquered senses. He is a storehouse of compassion and extremely skilled in the path of spiritual truth. Chaupai 1

In the month of Magha, when the sun enters the constellation of Capricorn, everyone comes to Prayag, the king of pilgrimage places. Groups of gods, demons, heavenly musicians, and humans all bathe in the confluence of the three rivers with reverence. Chaupai 2

They worship the lotus feet of Veni Madhava, a form of God at that place. They touch the eternal banyan tree and their bodies thrill with joy. The hermitage of Bharadwaja is extremely sacred, supremely beautiful, and pleasing to the minds of great sages. Chaupai 3

The gathering of sages and seers happens there when they come to bathe at the king of pilgrimage places. They all bathe in the morning with enthusiasm. Then they share stories of God's qualities with one another. Chaupai 4

They discuss the nature of the ultimate reality, the rules of righteous living, and the categories of truth. They speak of devotion to God, combined with wisdom and detachment. Doha 44

In this way they bathe throughout the month of Magha. Then everyone returns to their own hermitages. Every year there is great joy there. After bathing during the auspicious period, the groups of sages depart. Chaupai 1

## The Question That Started Everything
The sage Bharadwaja keeps the wise Yajnavalkya back to ask him a question that had been troubling his heart.

One time, after the full month of bathing was complete, all the great sages left for their hermitages. The supremely wise sage Yajnavalkya was about to leave. Bharadwaja held his feet and kept him back. Chaupai 2

He washed Yajnavalkya's lotus feet with reverence. He seated him on a very pure seat. After worshipping him and praising his good name, Bharadwaja spoke in extremely pure and gentle words. Chaupai 3

O lord! There is a great doubt in my mind. The essence of all the scriptures is in your grasp. You are the one who can resolve my confusion. But I feel fear and shame in asking this question. Fear because you might think I am testing you. Shame because so much of my life has passed and I still do not have this knowledge. Yet if I do not ask, great harm will come to me, for I will remain ignorant. Chaupai 4

O lord! The saints teach this principle. The scriptures, ancient texts, and sages all say the same thing. If you hide something from your teacher, pure wisdom cannot arise in your heart. Doha 45

Thinking this way, I reveal my ignorance to you. O lord! Have compassion on your servant and destroy this ignorance. The saints, the ancient texts, and the Upanishads have all sung of the limitless power of Rama's name. Chaupai 1

## Bharadwaja's Question About Rama
The sage asks the central question: who exactly is this Rama whose name even Shiva constantly repeats?

Shiva, the eternal lord who is the essence of blessedness, wisdom, and all good qualities, constantly repeats Rama's name. There are four kinds of living beings in this world. All who die in the holy city of Kashi attain the highest state. Chaupai 2

O king of sages! That too is the glory of Rama's name. For it is Rama's name that Shiva compassionately whispers into the ears of those dying in Kashi. That is why they reach the highest state. O lord! I ask you, who is this Rama? O ocean of mercy! Please explain this to me. Chaupai 3

One Rama is the prince of Ayodhya, son of King Dasharatha. The whole world knows his story. He suffered endless pain when separated from his wife Sita. In anger, he killed the ten-headed king in battle. Chaupai 4

O lord! Is this the same Rama whom Shiva worships? Or is it someone else? You are the home of truth and you know everything. Please tell me after considering it with your wisdom. Doha 46

## Yajnavalkya Agrees to Tell the Story
The wise sage smiles, recognizing Bharadwaja's cleverness, and agrees to tell the tale of how Parvati and Shiva discussed this same question.

O lord! Please tell me the story in such a way that my great confusion is removed. Yajnavalkya smiled and said, You already know the greatness of Rama. Chaupai 1

You are Rama's devotee in thought, word, and deed. I understand your cleverness now. You want to hear the hidden glories of Rama. That is why you have asked this question as if you were very foolish. Chaupai 2

Dear one! Listen with attention and respect. I will tell you the beautiful story of Rama. Great ignorance is like the mighty demon Mahishasura. Rama's story is like the fierce goddess Kali who destroys him. Chaupai 3

Rama's story is like moonbeams. Saints, who are like the chakora bird, drink it constantly. The chakora is a bird said to live only on moonbeams. Parvati once had this same doubt. Shiva then told her the whole story in detail. Chaupai 4

Now I will tell you, according to my understanding, the same dialogue between Parvati and Shiva. Listen, O sage, and hear when and why it took place. Your sorrow will be removed. Doha 47

## Shiva's Dilemma in the Forest
The story begins in an earlier age when Shiva saw Rama wandering in the forest, and faced a difficult choice.

Once, in the Treta age, Shiva went to visit the sage who was born from a pot. Parvati, the mother of the universe, who was then known as Sati, went with him. The sage recognized Shiva as the lord of all creation and worshipped him. Chaupai 1

The great sage told the story of Rama in detail. Shiva listened with supreme happiness. Then the sage asked Shiva about the beautiful path of devotion to God. Finding him worthy, Shiva explained devotion along with its secrets. Chaupai 2

Speaking and listening to the stories of Rama's qualities, Shiva stayed there for some days. Then, taking leave of the sage, Shiva headed home to Mount Kailash with his wife Sati. Chaupai 3

At that very time, God had taken birth in the family of Raghu to lighten the burden of the earth. Following his father's command, he had given up the kingdom. Living as a wandering ascetic, the eternal one was roaming in the Dandaka forest. Chaupai 4

## Shiva Sees Rama
Shiva spots Rama in the forest but faces a dilemma about whether to approach him.

As Shiva walked, he was wondering in his heart how he might have a vision of God. The lord has taken birth in a hidden form. If I go to him, everyone will come to know who he really is. Doha 48a

Great turmoil arose in Shiva's heart, but Sati did not understand what was happening. Tulsidas says that fear was in Shiva's mind, but longing for a vision made his eyes eager. Soratha 48b

The ten-headed king had once asked the creator god to grant that he could only be killed by a human. God wished to make the creator's words come true. Shiva thought, If I do not go now, I will always regret it. He kept thinking this way, but could find no solution that worked. Chaupai 1

In this way, the great lord fell into worry. At that very time, the ten-headed king, the wicked one, went and brought the demon Maricha with him. Maricha immediately transformed himself into a magical deer. Chaupai 2

Through this trick, the fool carried away Sita. He had no idea of Rama's true power. After killing the deer, Rama returned with his brother Lakshmana to the hermitage. Seeing it empty, finding Sita gone, tears filled their eyes. Chaupai 3

Rama, like an ordinary man, was distraught with grief. The two brothers wandered through the forest searching for Sita. He who never experiences union or separation was now openly showing the sorrow of separation. Chaupai 4

The nature of Rama is very mysterious. Only the truly wise understand it. Those with dull minds, under the spell of delusion, think something else entirely in their hearts. Doha 49

## Shiva's Silent Tribute
Shiva sees Rama but decides not to reveal himself, paying silent homage instead. Sati notices his strange behavior and begins to doubt.

At that very moment, Shiva saw Rama. Immense joy arose in his heart. He drank in the sight of that ocean of beauty with his eyes. But knowing it was not the right time, he did not introduce himself. Chaupai 1

Victory to the one who is truth, consciousness, and bliss! Victory to the one who purifies the world! Saying only this, Shiva, the destroyer of the god of love, walked on. The compassionate Shiva kept walking with Sati, again and again thrilling with joy. Chaupai 2

Sati saw this strange state of Shiva. A great doubt arose in her mind. She thought to herself, Shiva is worshipped by the whole world. He is the lord of creation. Gods, humans, and sages all bow their heads to him. Chaupai 3
