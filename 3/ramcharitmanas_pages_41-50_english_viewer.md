# Ramcharitmanas - Day 3

A prostitute kept a parrot. The parrot chanted "Rama, Rama" all day long. She ignored it completely. She continued her profession. She made no effort whatsoever. And when she died? The messengers of God came for her instead of the servants of death.

Today, Tulsidas tells us the Name of Rama is greater than Rama himself. Greater than God in form. Greater than the formless. And he's going to prove it - with a list of what Rama did versus what the Name does.

Let's read.

I'm Rahul. I read the Ramcharitmanas every day because I'm trying to learn what Tulsidas knew - how to bow. How to surrender. How to love something greater than yourself. I don't have all the answers - I'm just someone trying to surrender, one verse at a time.

Day three.


## The Name and the Named Are One

Tulsidas explores how the Name and the one who bears the Name are inseparable.

"When you truly understand, the Name and the Named are the same. Yet they love each other like a master and servant. When you call the Name, Rama follows it and appears.

Name and Form are both qualities of God. Both are beyond words. Both have no beginning. Only a pure heart filled with devotion can know their true nature." Chaupai 1

"It would be wrong to say one is greater, one is smaller. Wise people will understand the difference themselves after hearing about their qualities. The Form depends on the Name. Without the Name, you cannot know the Form." Chaupai 2

"Think about this. Even if someone is sitting right in your palm, you cannot recognize them without knowing their name. But if you remember someone's name with love, even without seeing them, their form appears in your heart." Chaupai 3

This is such a simple observation. You could hold someone's hand and not know who they are. But whisper a name you love - and instantly you see them.

"The story of Name and Form cannot be told in words. It brings joy to understand, but it cannot be described. The Name stands between the formless God and God with form. It is like a clever translator who can explain both to you." Chaupai 4

"If you want light both inside and outside yourself, place the jewel-lamp of Rama's Name on the threshold of your tongue. Your mouth is the doorway. Your tongue is the threshold. The Name is the lamp that lights up everything." Doha 21


## The Name Awakens Seekers

Different seekers use the Name for different purposes, and it serves them all.

"Yogis who have turned away from the world chant this Name with their tongues. Through it they awaken to true knowledge. They experience the indescribable, unchanging bliss of the Supreme - which has no name, no form, no sickness." Chaupai 1

"Those who want to know God's deepest secrets also chant the Name and come to know them. Practitioners who seek supernatural powers chant with concentration. They become perfected beings, gaining all eight mystical powers like becoming tiny as an atom or huge as a mountain." Chaupai 2

Tulsidas is listing the eight siddhis here - the mystical powers that yogis were said to attain. Anima - becoming small as an atom. Mahima - becoming infinitely large. Garima - infinite heaviness. Laghima - weightlessness, levitation. Prapti - obtaining anything, reaching anywhere. Prakamya - irresistible will. Ishitva - lordship over creation. Vashitva - control over all beings. All of this, he says, comes through the Name.

"People in great distress chant the Name, and their terrible troubles disappear. They become happy.

There are four types of devotees in this world: those who want wealth, those who want relief from suffering, those who want to know God, and those who already know God and love him naturally. All four are virtuous, sinless, and noble." Chaupai 3

"All four types of devotees depend on the Name. Among them, the one who truly knows God is especially dear to the Lord. The Name has power in all four ages and all four Vedas. But in this dark age of Kali, its power is special. In Kali Yuga, there is no other way." Chaupai 4

"Even those who want nothing, even those completely absorbed in the joy of loving Rama, have made their minds like fish swimming in the sweet nectar-lake of the Name. Just as a fish cannot live outside water even for a moment, they cannot live without the Name even for a moment." Doha 22


## The Name Is Greater Than God Himself

Tulsidas makes his bold claim: the Name is even greater than the formless and the form of God.

-

"God has two forms: the formless and the one with form. Both are beyond words, beyond measure, without beginning, without equal.

But in my view, the Name is greater than both. By its own power, the Name has made both forms obey it." Chaupai 1

"Good people should not think this is my arrogance or just poetic exaggeration. I speak from my heart's faith, love, and feeling.

Understanding these two forms of God is like understanding fire. The formless God is like fire hidden inside wood - it exists but you cannot see it. God with form is like fire burning openly that everyone can see.

Both are the same fire, really. One is hidden, one is visible.

Both forms of God are difficult to know. But through the Name, both become easy to reach.

That is why I say the Name is greater than both the formless God and Rama with form." Chaupai 2-3

-

"The formless God is all-pervading, one, indestructible, pure existence, pure consciousness, pure bliss.

Even though such a perfect Lord lives in every heart, all beings in this world remain poor and suffering. By understanding the Name and practicing the Name with faith, that same God becomes visible - just as knowing about a gem reveals its true value." Chaupai 4

"In this way, the Name's power is far greater than the formless God's. Now I will explain, according to my own thinking, why the Name is also greater than Rama himself." Doha 23

This is where Tulsidas is going to prove his case. He's about to compare - action by action - what Rama did in person versus what the Name accomplishes.


## Rama Suffered, But the Name Saves Effortlessly

Tulsidas compares what Rama did in person versus what his Name accomplishes.

"Rama took a human body to help his devotees. He bore great hardship himself to make the saints happy. But devotees simply chant the Name with love, and effortlessly they become homes of joy and blessings." Chaupai 1

"Rama liberated one woman - the wife of a sage named Gautama. She was Ahalya, who had been cursed and turned to stone. When Rama's feet touched her, she was freed. But the Name has corrected the corrupted minds of millions of wicked people.

Rama killed the demoness and her son along with their army to help the sage who was performing rituals. But the Name destroys the faults, sorrows, and false hopes of devotees the way the sun destroys night.

Rama broke Shiva's bow with his own hands. But the Name's glory is what destroys all fears of worldly existence." Chaupai 2-3

He's setting up the pattern now. Rama did something specific, physical, individual. The Name does something universal, effortless, infinite.

Ahalya was one woman freed from stone. Tadaka was one demoness killed. The bow was broken once. But the Name works on millions. The Name works always. The Name works without Rama having to walk anywhere.

"Rama made the terrible Dandaka forest beautiful. But the Name has purified countless human hearts. Rama killed hordes of demons. But the Name uproots all the sins of this dark age of Kali." Chaupai 4

"Rama gave liberation to the forest woman Shabari and to the vulture Jatayu - these were his devoted servants. Jatayu was an old vulture who fought the demon king to protect Sita and died in Rama's arms. Shabari was an outcast woman who spent her whole life waiting for Rama, tasting berries to find the sweetest ones for him.

But the Name has saved countless sinners. The glory of the Name is famous in all the Vedas." Doha 24

Let me tell you about Shabari. She was from a low-caste tribal community - "untouchable" by the standards of her time. Her guru told her Rama would come. So she waited. Decades. Every day cleaning the path. Every day collecting berries. And she would taste each berry first - keeping only the sweet ones for Rama, spitting out the bitter ones.

When Rama finally arrived, he ate those already-tasted berries. By orthodox standards, they were polluted. But Rama saw only her love.

And Jatayu - an aged vulture who was a friend of Rama's father. When Ravana abducted Sita, Jatayu heard her cries and attacked. Old, outmatched, he fought anyway. Ravana cut off his wings. When Rama found him dying, Jatayu told him which way Sita had been taken. Rama wept. He performed Jatayu's last rites as a son would for his father.

These two - an untouchable woman and a dying bird - received God's love. But Tulsidas says: they were just two. The Name has saved countless.

"Rama took Sugriva and Vibhishana under his protection - this everyone knows. Sugriva was a monkey king in exile; Vibhishana was the demon king's own brother who abandoned evil and came to Rama. But the Name has blessed countless poor souls. This beautiful reputation of the Name shines in both the world and the scriptures." Chaupai 1

"Rama gathered an army of bears and monkeys. He worked hard to build a bridge across the ocean to reach the island where Sita was held captive. But simply by taking the Name, the ocean of worldly existence dries up completely.

Think about this in your heart, good people - which is greater?" Chaupai 2

"Rama killed the ten-headed king along with his entire clan in battle. Then with Sita he returned to his own city. Rama became king and Ayodhya his capital. Gods and sages sang his praises in beautiful words.

But devotees simply remember the Name with love. Without any effort they conquer the mighty army of delusion. They wander about, absorbed in love, content in their own happiness. By the grace of the Name, worry never touches them even in dreams." Chaupai 3-4

"In this way, the Name is greater than both the formless God and Rama with form. The Name gives blessings even to those who give blessings.

Shiva knew this in his heart. That is why from a hundred million stories of Rama, he chose this Name 'Rama' as the essence." Doha 25


## Great Souls Who Found the Name

Examples of those transformed by the Name's power.

"By the grace of the Name alone, Shiva is indestructible. Though his appearance seems inauspicious - he wears ashes, sits in cremation grounds, has snakes around his neck - he is still the treasure house of all auspiciousness.

The sage Shukadeva, the four child-sages called Sanakadi, and all accomplished saints, sages, and yogis - all enjoy the bliss of the Supreme by the grace of the Name alone." Chaupai 1

"The wandering saint Narada knows the power of the Name. Vishnu is dear to the whole world. Shiva is dear to Vishnu. And Narada is dear to both Vishnu and Shiva.

By chanting the Name, the Lord showed grace to young Prahlada, and he became the crown jewel among devotees." Chaupai 2

-

"Prahlada was the son of a demon king who hated God. But even as a child, Prahlada loved God. His father tried to kill him many times - by poison, by fire, by crushing elephants, by throwing him from cliffs. Each time, the Name protected Prahlada.

Finally, God himself appeared as a half-lion, half-man and destroyed the demon, making Prahlada the king." Chaupai 2 (continued)

The demon king had conquered three worlds. He had a boon - he could not be killed by man or beast, indoors or outdoors, by day or night, on earth or in sky, by any weapon. So he declared himself God.

Finally he demanded: "Where is your God? Is he in this pillar?"

Prahlada said calmly: "He is everywhere."

The king struck the pillar - and Vishnu burst forth as Narasimha. Half-lion, half-man. At twilight - neither day nor night. On the threshold - neither inside nor outside. Placing the demon on his lap - neither earth nor sky. Tearing him apart with claws - no weapon.

Every loophole closed. Every protection shattered.

"Those who chant the Name are like young Prahlada - the Name will protect them by destroying the demon of this evil age."

-

-

"Young Dhruva chanted God's name out of grief. His stepmother had insulted him, telling him he had no right to sit on his father's lap since he was not born from her womb. Heartbroken, the five-year-old went to the forest to find God.

Through the Name he gained an eternal, matchless place - a star that never moves, forever shining in the night sky." Chaupai 3

A five-year-old, rejected and humiliated, walked into the wilderness to find God. And he became the Pole Star. Dhruva Tara. The one star that never moves while all others revolve around it.

A symbol of unwavering devotion.

-

"Hanuman kept Rama under his spell by remembering the pure Name. Through his devotion to the Name, Hanuman made even God do his bidding." Chaupai 3 (continued)


## The Three Sinners

Now we come to the story I mentioned at the beginning. Three sinners. Three different levels of effort. All saved.

"The fallen sinner Ajamila, the elephant caught by a crocodile, the prostitute who was used to sell her body - all became free by the power of God's name." Chaupai 4 (opening)

"Ajamila had lived a sinful life, but at death he called out 'Narayana!' - which was actually his son's name. That accidental utterance saved him.

The elephant, caught in a crocodile's grip, remembered God and was rescued.

The prostitute simply kept a parrot who chanted 'Rama, Rama' and that sound purified her.

How far can I describe the greatness of the Name? Even Rama himself cannot fully sing the glories of the Name." Chaupai 4

Now let me tell you these three stories properly.

-

Ajamila. He was born a Brahmin, lived virtuously, devoted to scripture. Then he saw a beautiful woman and abandoned everything - his wife, his dharma, his duties. He turned to gambling, theft, cheating. Decades of sin.

He named his youngest son Narayana.

At eighty-eight years old, death came. He saw the terrifying messengers of Yama approaching with nooses. In fear, he cried out for his son: "Narayana! Narayana!"

Instantly, the messengers of Vishnu appeared. They drove away the servants of death.

Because anyone who utters God's name - even accidentally, even without understanding - is freed.

He wasn't praying. He was calling his child. And it saved him.

-

-

Gajendra, the elephant king. He led his herd to a cool lake. A crocodile seized his leg.

On land, the elephant was supreme. In water, the crocodile was.

They struggled for a thousand years in divine time. Slowly Gajendra weakened. His herd could not help. His own strength was failing.

In that moment of utter helplessness - when all pride was exhausted - he raised his trunk, offered a lotus to the sky, and cried out to Vishnu with whatever words his elephant-mind could form.

Vishnu descended immediately on Garuda and severed the crocodile's head.

When all other supports fail and we surrender completely, God responds instantly.

-

-

Pingala, the prostitute. No scripture knowledge. No practice. No guru.

But she kept a parrot that chanted "Rama, Rama, Rama" continuously. She ignored it. She continued her profession. She made no effort whatsoever.

But when death came, the messengers of Vishnu arrived instead of the servants of death. The constant presence of the Name - even heard passively - had purified her soul.

Ajamila spoke the Name - but by accident.
Gajendra called out - but in desperation, not devotion.
Pingala did nothing at all.

The Name works like fire. It doesn't ask if you understand combustion.

-

"In this dark age of Kali, Rama's Name is a wish-fulfilling tree. It is the home of all blessings. By remembering it, even worthless Tulsidas - who was like a useless hemp plant - became pure like the sacred tulsi plant." Doha 26


## The Name Is the Only Hope in Kali Yuga

Why the Name matters especially now, in this dark age.

"In all four ages, in all three times, in all three worlds, beings have become free from sorrow by chanting the Name. The Vedas, the ancient stories, and all the saints agree: the fruit of all good deeds is to develop love for Rama and his Name." Chaupai 1

"In the first age, people pleased God through meditation. In the second age, through rituals and sacrifices. In the third age, through worship.

But this dark age of Kali is the root of all impurity. It is dirty and degraded. People's minds have become like fish swimming in an ocean of sin - they do not want to leave it even for a moment. This makes meditation, rituals, and worship nearly impossible." Chaupai 2

"In such a terrible time, the Name is the only wish-fulfilling tree. Just remembering it destroys all the tangles of worldly life.

In this dark age, Rama's Name gives you whatever your heart desires. It is the best friend for the next world. It is like mother and father in this world - protecting and caring for you completely." Chaupai 3

"In Kali Yuga there is no real spiritual practice, no real devotion, no real wisdom. The Name of Rama is the only support.

This dark age is like the demon Kalanemi - a storehouse of deception. Once, a demon named Kalanemi disguised himself as a holy man to trick Hanuman. But Hanuman saw through the disguise and killed him.

In the same way, the Name is like the wise and mighty Hanuman - it sees through all the tricks of this deceptive age and destroys them." Chaupai 4

Kalanemi. During the battle in Lanka, Lakshmana was struck by a deadly weapon. Only the Sanjeevani herb from the Himalayas could save him - and it had to arrive before dawn. Hanuman flew north. Ravana sent Kalanemi to stop him.

Kalanemi created an illusion - a beautiful ashram, a tranquil lake, himself disguised as a serene sage. He welcomed Hanuman, offered rest, suggested he bathe in the sacred lake first. But a crocodile demon lurked beneath.

Hanuman killed the crocodile. A cursed nymph was freed. She revealed the truth. Hanuman seized the false sage and smashed him to the ground.

Tulsidas says: the Kali Yuga is like Kalanemi. It appears normal but is filled with hidden traps. And the Name is like Hanuman - it sees through all disguises.

"Rama's Name is like the half-lion God who burst from a pillar. This dark age of Kali is like the demon king who thought he could never be killed. Those who chant the Name are like young Prahlada - the Name will protect them by destroying the demon of this evil age." Doha 27

"Whether you chant with love or hate, with anger or laziness - chanting the Name brings blessings from all ten directions. Remembering this Name and bowing my head to Rama, I now begin to describe his glorious qualities." Chaupai 1


## The Poet's Humble Plea

Tulsidas expresses his unworthiness and his faith in Rama's grace.

"He will set everything right for me in every way. His grace never gets tired of being gracious.

What a master Rama is, and what a poor servant I am! Yet that ocean of mercy, looking at things from his own generous perspective, has taken care of me." Chaupai 2

"In the world and in the scriptures, this is known as the way of a good master: he recognizes love just by hearing someone's humble words. Rich or poor, villager or city dweller, learned or foolish, disgraced or famous -" Chaupai 3

"Good poets and bad poets, all men and women, each according to their own understanding, praise the king. And a king who is saintly, wise, gentle, born from God's own essence, supremely kind -" Chaupai 4

"Such a king listens to everyone. He recognizes their words, their devotion, their humility, their sincerity. He honors everyone appropriately with sweet words. This is the nature of worldly kings.

But the Lord of Kosala, Rama, is the wisest of all." Chaupai 5

"Rama is pleased only by pure love. Who in this world is more foolish and impure-minded than me?" Chaupai 6

"Yet gracious Rama will surely honor the love and devotion of even this wicked servant. He made stones float like boats to build his bridge across the ocean. He made monkeys and bears into wise ministers." Doha 28(a)

"Everyone calls me Rama's servant. I too let myself be called that without shame. Kind Rama bears this insult - that a master like him should have a servant like Tulsidas." Doha 28(b)

"This is my great audacity and fault. Hearing of my sins, even hell wrinkles its nose in disgust - there is no place for me even there! Understanding this, I tremble with my own imagined fears.

But Rama has never given even a dream's worth of attention to my faults." Chaupai 1

"Instead, my Lord listened, watched, and examined my heart with his pure inner eye. He praised my devotion and understanding!

What you say with your mouth may be flawed. But if goodness lives in your heart, that is what matters. In my heart I truly consider myself unworthy of being his servant - I see myself as a sinner, as lowly. This is the goodness within.

Rama sees this state of his servant's heart and is pleased." Chaupai 2

"The Lord does not remember the mistakes his devotees make. He remembers their heart's goodness a hundred times over.

For the same sin that made Rama kill the monkey king Bali like a hunter shooting from hiding, Sugriva later did something similar. Sugriva forgot his promise to help Rama search for Sita, lost in his own pleasures." Chaupai 3

Bali - killed for taking his brother's wife and persecuting him. Sugriva - forgiven for forgetting his sacred promise and indulging in pleasures. The same sin. Different responses. Why? Sugriva was Rama's devotee. Bali was not. God holds his devotees to a different standard.

"Vibhishana did something similar too - he betrayed his own brother, the demon king. But Rama never held this against him, not even in a dream. Instead, when Rama met his devoted brother Bharata, he honored Vibhishana publicly. In the royal court, Rama praised Vibhishana's virtues." Chaupai 4

"The Lord stood beneath the trees while monkeys sat on the branches above him. Think about this: on one side, the Supreme Lord of all existence. On the other, monkeys jumping from branch to branch.

Yet Rama made those very monkeys equal to himself.

Tulsidas says: nowhere will you find a master as gracious and humble as Rama." Doha 29(a)

"O Rama, through your goodness, everyone finds their good. If this is always true, then even Tulsidas will always be blessed." Doha 29(b)

"In this way, having spoken of my own virtues and faults, and having bowed to everyone, I now describe the pure glory of Rama. Hearing it, all the sins of this dark age will be destroyed." Doha 29(c)


## Reflection

What we just read is one of the most radical claims in devotional literature. The Name is greater than God. Not because God is diminished - but because the Name makes God accessible.

Rama had to walk to the stone to free Ahalya. But the Name travels everywhere.
Rama had to suffer to help his devotees. But the Name brings joy effortlessly.
Rama saved a few. The Name saves millions.

And then those three sinners. Ajamila called the Name by accident. Gajendra called in desperation. Pingala didn't call at all - she just had a parrot.

Every excuse we have - "I don't know how," "I'm not pure enough," "I haven't practiced" - Tulsidas demolishes them all.

The Name works like fire. It doesn't ask if you understand combustion.

Tomorrow, Tulsidas will begin telling us the actual story. Where it came from. Who told it first. Why it matters that this conversation happened between Shiva and Parvati.

The stage is finally set.

If you're finding value in this daily practice, consider subscribing. We're reading this together, one verse at a time.

See you tomorrow.
