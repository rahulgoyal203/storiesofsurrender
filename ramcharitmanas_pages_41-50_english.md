## The Name and the Named Are One

Tulsidas explores how the Name and the one who bears the Name are inseparable.

When you truly understand, the Name and the Named are the same. Yet they love each other like a master and servant. When you call the Name, Rama follows it and appears. Name and Form are both qualities of God. Both are beyond words. Both have no beginning. Only a pure heart filled with devotion can know their true nature. Chaupai 1

It would be wrong to say one is greater, one is smaller. Wise people will understand the difference themselves after hearing about their qualities. The Form depends on the Name. Without the Name, you cannot know the Form. Chaupai 2

Think about this. Even if someone is sitting right in your palm, you cannot recognize them without knowing their name. But if you remember someone's name with love, even without seeing them, their form appears in your heart. Chaupai 3

The story of Name and Form cannot be told in words. It brings joy to understand, but it cannot be described. The Name stands between the formless God and God with form. It is like a clever translator who can explain both to you. Chaupai 4

If you want light both inside and outside yourself, place the jewel-lamp of Rama's Name on the threshold of your tongue. Your mouth is the doorway. Your tongue is the threshold. The Name is the lamp that lights up everything. Doha 21

## The Name Awakens Seekers

Different seekers use the Name for different purposes, and it serves them all.

Yogis who have turned away from the world chant this Name with their tongues. Through it they awaken to true knowledge. They experience the indescribable, unchanging bliss of the Supreme - which has no name, no form, no sickness. Chaupai 1

Those who want to know God's deepest secrets also chant the Name and come to know them. Practitioners who seek supernatural powers chant with concentration. They become perfected beings, gaining all eight mystical powers like becoming tiny as an atom or huge as a mountain. Chaupai 2

> **The Eight Mystical Powers (Ashta Siddhis):**
> 1. *Anima* - Becoming as tiny as an atom
> 2. *Mahima* - Becoming infinitely large
> 3. *Garima* - Becoming infinitely heavy
> 4. *Laghima* - Becoming weightless (levitation)
> 5. *Prapti* - Obtaining anything desired; reaching anywhere
> 6. *Prakamya* - Realizing any wish; irresistible will
> 7. *Ishitva* - Lordship over creation; control of nature
> 8. *Vashitva* - Power to control all beings and elements

People in great distress chant the Name, and their terrible troubles disappear. They become happy. There are four types of devotees in this world: those who want wealth, those who want relief from suffering, those who want to know God, and those who already know God and love him naturally. All four are virtuous, sinless, and noble. Chaupai 3

All four types of devotees depend on the Name. Among them, the one who truly knows God is especially dear to the Lord. The Name has power in all four ages and all four Vedas. But in this dark age of Kali, its power is special. In Kali Yuga, there is no other way. Chaupai 4

Even those who want nothing, even those completely absorbed in the joy of loving Rama, have made their minds like fish swimming in the sweet nectar-lake of the Name. Just as a fish cannot live outside water even for a moment, they cannot live without the Name even for a moment. Doha 22

## The Name Is Greater Than God Himself

Tulsidas makes his bold claim: the Name is even greater than the formless and the form of God.

God has two forms: the formless and the one with form. Both are beyond words, beyond measure, without beginning, without equal. But in my view, the Name is greater than both. By its own power, the Name has made both forms obey it. Chaupai 1

Good people should not think this is my arrogance or just poetic exaggeration. I speak from my heart's faith, love, and feeling. Understanding these two forms of God is like understanding fire. The formless God is like fire hidden inside wood - it exists but you cannot see it. God with form is like fire burning openly that everyone can see. Both are the same fire, really. One is hidden, one is visible. Both forms of God are difficult to know. But through the Name, both become easy to reach. That is why I say the Name is greater than both the formless God and Rama with form. The formless God is all-pervading, one, indestructible, pure existence, pure consciousness, pure bliss. Chaupai 2-3

Even though such a perfect Lord lives in every heart, all beings in this world remain poor and suffering. By understanding the Name and practicing the Name with faith, that same God becomes visible - just as knowing about a gem reveals its true value. Chaupai 4

In this way, the Name's power is far greater than the formless God's. Now I will explain, according to my own thinking, why the Name is also greater than Rama himself. Doha 23

## Rama Suffered, But the Name Saves Effortlessly

Tulsidas compares what Rama did in person versus what his Name accomplishes.

Rama took a human body to help his devotees. He bore great hardship himself to make the saints happy. But devotees simply chant the Name with love, and effortlessly they become homes of joy and blessings. Chaupai 1

Rama liberated one woman - the wife of a sage named Gautama. She was Ahalya, who had been cursed and turned to stone. When Rama's feet touched her, she was freed. But the Name has corrected the corrupted minds of millions of wicked people. Rama killed the demoness and her son along with their army to help the sage who was performing rituals. But the Name destroys the faults, sorrows, and false hopes of devotees the way the sun destroys night. Rama broke Shiva's bow with his own hands. But the Name's glory is what destroys all fears of worldly existence. Chaupai 2-3

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Ahalya's Liberation** — Ahalya was the wife of sage Gautama and was considered the most beautiful woman created by Brahma. Indra, king of the gods, disguised himself as Gautama to deceive her. When Gautama discovered this, he cursed Ahalya to become a stone. She would remain this way until Rama's feet touched her. When young Rama, traveling with sage Vishwamitra, stepped into Gautama's abandoned ashram, his foot touched the stone. Ahalya was instantly restored and reunited with her husband.
>
> **2. Tadaka and Maricha** — Tadaka was a powerful demoness who, along with her son Maricha, terrorized the forest where sage Vishwamitra performed sacred rituals. They would rain blood and bones on the sacrificial fire. Vishwamitra asked King Dasharatha to send young Rama and Lakshmana to protect his rituals. Rama killed Tadaka with a single arrow and drove away Maricha.
>
> **3. Breaking Shiva's Bow** — King Janaka of Mithila possessed an ancient, impossibly heavy bow belonging to Lord Shiva. He declared that whoever could string this bow would marry his daughter Sita. Many kings tried and failed—they couldn't even lift it. When Rama stepped forward, he not only lifted the bow effortlessly but broke it in half while stringing it. The sound thundered across the three worlds, and Rama won Sita's hand in marriage.

Rama made the terrible Dandaka forest beautiful. But the Name has purified countless human hearts. Rama killed hordes of demons. But the Name uproots all the sins of this dark age of Kali. Chaupai 4

Rama gave liberation to the forest woman Shabari and to the vulture Jatayu - these were his devoted servants. Jatayu was an old vulture who fought the demon king to protect Sita and died in Rama's arms. Shabari was an outcast woman who spent her whole life waiting for Rama, tasting berries to find the sweetest ones for him. But the Name has saved countless sinners. The glory of the Name is famous in all the Vedas. Doha 24

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Shabari** — Shabari was an elderly woman from a low-caste tribal community, considered "untouchable" by society. Her guru, sage Matanga, told her before dying that Lord Rama would one day visit her. She spent decades waiting, cleaning the forest path daily, and collecting wild berries. Each morning she would taste every berry first, keeping only the sweetest ones for Rama and discarding the bitter ones. When Rama finally arrived during his search for Sita, he lovingly ate her already-tasted berries—an act that would be considered polluted by orthodox standards. Rama saw only her pure devotion. After receiving him, Shabari entered the fire and attained liberation. Her story shows that God accepts love, not caste or ritual purity.
>
> **2. Jatayu** — Jatayu was an aged vulture king who had been a friend of Rama's father, King Dasharatha. When Ravana abducted Sita and flew over the forest in his aerial chariot, Jatayu heard her cries. Though old and no match for the demon king, he attacked Ravana to save Sita. A fierce battle ensued. Ravana eventually cut off Jatayu's wings with his sword, and the vulture fell mortally wounded. When Rama found him dying, Jatayu used his last breaths to tell Rama that Ravana had taken Sita southward. Rama held Jatayu in his arms, weeping, and performed his last rites as a son would for his own father—granting the vulture liberation. Jatayu's sacrifice is remembered as the ultimate example of selfless service.

Rama took Sugriva and Vibhishana under his protection - this everyone knows. Sugriva was a monkey king in exile; Vibhishana was the demon king's own brother who abandoned evil and came to Rama. But the Name has blessed countless poor souls. This beautiful reputation of the Name shines in both the world and the scriptures. Chaupai 1

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Sugriva** — Sugriva was a vanara (monkey) prince whose elder brother Bali was king of Kishkindha. A misunderstanding led Bali to believe Sugriva had betrayed him, and in his rage, Bali exiled Sugriva and took his wife. Sugriva lived in hiding on Mount Rishyamukha, the one place Bali could not enter due to a curse. When Rama came searching for Sita, Hanuman brought him to Sugriva. The two formed an alliance: Rama would help Sugriva regain his kingdom, and Sugriva would help Rama find Sita. Rama killed Bali with a single arrow, and Sugriva became king. Though Sugriva later forgot his promise while enjoying royal pleasures, Rama forgave him. Sugriva then sent his monkey armies in all directions, eventually leading to the discovery of Sita in Lanka.
>
> **2. Vibhishana** — Vibhishana was the younger brother of Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. Unlike his brother, Vibhishana was righteous and devoted to dharma. When Ravana abducted Sita, Vibhishana repeatedly urged him to return her honorably, warning that this act would destroy their entire clan. Ravana mocked and kicked him, calling him a traitor. Vibhishana then made the painful decision to leave his home, family, and kingdom to seek refuge with Rama. When he arrived at Rama's camp, many in the army were suspicious—how could the enemy's own brother be trusted? But Rama declared, "Anyone who comes to me even once saying 'I am yours,' I grant them fearlessness. This is my vow." Rama not only accepted Vibhishana but crowned him king of Lanka even before the war was won. After Ravana's death, Vibhishana ruled Lanka righteously for ages.

Rama gathered an army of bears and monkeys. He worked hard to build a bridge across the ocean to reach the island where Sita was held captive. But simply by taking the Name, the ocean of worldly existence dries up completely. Think about this in your heart, good people - which is greater? Chaupai 2

Rama killed the ten-headed king along with his entire clan in battle. Then with Sita he returned to his own city. Rama became king and Ayodhya his capital. Gods and sages sang his praises in beautiful words. But devotees simply remember the Name with love. Without any effort they conquer the mighty army of delusion. They wander about, absorbed in love, content in their own happiness. By the grace of the Name, worry never touches them even in dreams. Chaupai 3-4

In this way, the Name is greater than both the formless God and Rama with form. The Name gives blessings even to those who give blessings. Shiva knew this in his heart. That is why from a hundred million stories of Rama, he chose this Name "Rama" as the essence. Doha 25

## Great Souls Who Found the Name

Examples of those transformed by the Name's power.

By the grace of the Name alone, Shiva is indestructible. Though his appearance seems inauspicious - he wears ashes, sits in cremation grounds, has snakes around his neck - he is still the treasure house of all auspiciousness. The sage Shukadeva, the four child-sages called Sanakadi, and all accomplished saints, sages, and yogis - all enjoy the bliss of the Supreme by the grace of the Name alone. Chaupai 1

The wandering saint Narada knows the power of the Name. Vishnu is dear to the whole world. Shiva is dear to Vishnu. And Narada is dear to both Vishnu and Shiva. By chanting the Name, the Lord showed grace to young Prahlada, and he became the crown jewel among devotees. Prahlada was the son of a demon king who hated God. But even as a child, Prahlada loved God. His father tried to kill him many times - by poison, by fire, by crushing elephants, by throwing him from cliffs. Each time, the Name protected Prahlada. Finally, God himself appeared as a half-lion, half-man and destroyed the demon, making Prahlada the king. Chaupai 2

Young Dhruva chanted God's name out of grief. His stepmother had insulted him, telling him he had no right to sit on his father's lap since he was not born from her womb. Heartbroken, the five-year-old went to the forest to find God. Through the Name he gained an eternal, matchless place - a star that never moves, forever shining in the night sky. Hanuman kept Rama under his spell by remembering the pure Name. Through his devotion to the Name, Hanuman made even God do his bidding. Chaupai 3

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Prahlada** — Prahlada was born as the son of Hiranyakashipu, a powerful demon king who had conquered the three worlds. Hiranyakashipu had performed severe austerities and received a boon that made him nearly immortal—he could not be killed by man or beast, indoors or outdoors, by day or night, on earth or in sky, by any weapon. Drunk with power, he declared himself God and forbade all worship of Vishnu. But his own son Prahlada, even as a small child, was an unwavering devotee of Vishnu. No matter what his father did—poisoning his food, throwing him off cliffs, trampling him with elephants, casting him into fire, dropping him in a pit of venomous snakes—Prahlada emerged unharmed, always chanting God's name. Enraged, Hiranyakashipu finally demanded: "Where is your God? Is he in this pillar?" Prahlada calmly replied, "He is everywhere." Hiranyakashipu struck the pillar with his mace, and Lord Vishnu burst forth as Narasimha—half-lion, half-man. At twilight (neither day nor night), on the threshold (neither inside nor outside), placing the demon on his lap (neither earth nor sky), Narasimha tore Hiranyakashipu apart with his claws (no weapon). Young Prahlada then became king and ruled with righteousness.
>
> **2. Dhruva** — Dhruva was a five-year-old prince, son of King Uttanapada. One day, he climbed onto his father's lap, but his stepmother Suruchi cruelly pulled him away, saying: "Only my son has the right to sit there. You should have been born from my womb if you wanted such privileges. Go pray to God if you want a place of honor." Heartbroken but determined, the little boy walked into the forest to find God. The sage Narada, moved by his resolve, gave him a mantra and instructions for worship. For six months, Dhruva performed intense austerities—standing on one foot, eating only dry leaves, then nothing at all, finally even stopping his breath. His concentration was so powerful that the universe began to shake. Lord Vishnu appeared before him, pleased beyond measure. By then, Dhruva's heart had transformed; he no longer wanted a throne—he had found something greater. Yet Vishnu blessed him with both: an earthly kingdom and, after death, an eternal position as the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara)—the one star that never moves while all others revolve around it, a symbol of unwavering devotion.

The fallen sinner Ajamila, the elephant caught by a crocodile, the prostitute who was used to sell her body - all became free by the power of God's name. Ajamila had lived a sinful life, but at death he called out "Narayana!" - which was actually his son's name. That accidental utterance saved him. The elephant, caught in a crocodile's grip, remembered God and was rescued. The prostitute simply kept a parrot who chanted "Rama, Rama" and that sound purified her. How far can I describe the greatness of the Name? Even Rama himself cannot fully sing the glories of the Name. Chaupai 4

> **Stories Referenced:**
>
> **1. Ajamila** — Ajamila was born a Brahmin and lived virtuously in his youth, devoted to scripture and ritual. But one day he saw a beautiful low-caste woman and became infatuated. He abandoned his wife, his duties, and his dharma. To support his new family, he turned to gambling, theft, and cheating. He fathered ten sons with this woman and named the youngest "Narayana" (a name of Vishnu). Decades passed in sin. When Ajamila was eighty-eight years old, death came. He saw the terrifying messengers of Yama, lord of death, approaching with nooses to drag his soul to hell. In fear and desperation, he cried out for his beloved youngest son: "Narayana! Narayana!" Instantly, the radiant messengers of Vishnu appeared. They drove away the servants of death, declaring that anyone who utters God's name—even accidentally, even without understanding—is freed from all sins. Ajamila was given a second chance. He spent his remaining years as a true devotee and attained liberation. His story proves that the Name works even when spoken unintentionally.
>
> **2. Gajendra (The Elephant)** — Gajendra was a mighty elephant king who ruled his herd in a beautiful mountain forest. One day, tormented by heat, he led his herd to a cool lake to bathe. As Gajendra waded into the water, a powerful crocodile seized his leg in its jaws. A terrible struggle began. On land, the elephant was supreme; in water, the crocodile had the advantage. They fought for a thousand years (in divine time). Slowly, Gajendra weakened while the crocodile grew stronger. His herd could not help him; his own strength was failing. In that moment of utter helplessness—when all pride, all self-reliance was exhausted—Gajendra raised his trunk and offered a lotus to the sky, crying out to Vishnu with whatever words his elephant-mind could form: "O Adi-mula! O Original Cause!" Lord Vishnu immediately descended on Garuda, his divine eagle. With his discus, he severed the crocodile's head and lifted Gajendra to safety. The teaching: when all other supports fail and we surrender completely, God responds instantly.
>
> **3. Pingala (The Prostitute)** — Pingala was a courtesan who lived by selling her body. She had no knowledge of scripture, no spiritual practice, no guru. But she kept a pet parrot in her home, and this parrot had somehow learned to repeat "Rama, Rama, Rama" continuously. Day after day, night after night, the sound of the divine Name filled her dwelling. Though Pingala paid no attention to it, though she continued her profession, the Name was working silently. When death came for her, the messengers of Vishnu arrived instead of the servants of Yama. They declared that the constant presence of the Name—even heard passively, even without devotion—had purified her soul. She was taken to Vishnu's realm. Her story is perhaps the most radical: she made no effort at all, yet the Name saved her simply because it was present in her environment. This is why saints recommend keeping the Name always in one's surroundings.

> **Why These Three Stories Together?**
>
> | Story | Effort Level | Intent | Teaching |
> |-------|--------------|--------|----------|
> | Ajamila | Spoke the Name | Accidental (calling his son) | Name works without intention |
> | Gajendra | Called out in crisis | Desperate, not devotional | Name works without eloquence |

>
> Tulsidas arranges them this way to systematically dismantle every excuse: "I don't know the right words," "I'm not sincere enough," "I haven't practiced." The Name's power is intrinsic—it works like fire that burns whether you understand chemistry or not.

In this dark age of Kali, Rama's Name is a wish-fulfilling tree. It is the home of all blessings. By remembering it, even worthless Tulsidas - who was like a useless hemp plant - became pure like the sacred tulsi plant. Doha 26

## The Name Is the Only Hope in Kali Yuga

Why the Name matters especially now, in this dark age.

In all four ages, in all three times, in all three worlds, beings have become free from sorrow by chanting the Name. The Vedas, the ancient stories, and all the saints agree: the fruit of all good deeds is to develop love for Rama and his Name. Chaupai 1

In the first age, people pleased God through meditation. In the second age, through rituals and sacrifices. In the third age, through worship. But this dark age of Kali is the root of all impurity. It is dirty and degraded. People's minds have become like fish swimming in an ocean of sin - they do not want to leave it even for a moment. This makes meditation, rituals, and worship nearly impossible. Chaupai 2

In such a terrible time, the Name is the only wish-fulfilling tree. Just remembering it destroys all the tangles of worldly life. In this dark age, Rama's Name gives you whatever your heart desires. It is the best friend for the next world. It is like mother and father in this world - protecting and caring for you completely. Chaupai 3

In Kali Yuga there is no real spiritual practice, no real devotion, no real wisdom. The Name of Rama is the only support. This dark age is like the demon Kalanemi - a storehouse of deception. Once, a demon named Kalanemi disguised himself as a holy man to trick Hanuman. But Hanuman saw through the disguise and killed him. In the same way, the Name is like the wise and mighty Hanuman - it sees through all the tricks of this deceptive age and destroys them. Chaupai 4

> **Story Referenced:**
>
> **Kalanemi** — During the great battle in Lanka, Ravana's son Indrajit (Meghanada) struck Lakshmana with a deadly weapon called the Shakti. Lakshmana fell unconscious, hovering between life and death. The physician Sushena declared that only the Sanjeevani herb, found on Mount Dronagiri in the Himalayas, could save him—and it had to be brought before dawn, or Lakshmana would die. Hanuman immediately leaped into the sky, flying north at impossible speed. Ravana, desperate to prevent this, summoned his uncle Kalanemi—a powerful sorcerer whose very name means "the wheel of time/death." Ravana commanded him: "Stop Hanuman by any means. Use your magic." Kalanemi knew this was a death sentence—he had received a prophecy that Hanuman would kill him. But Ravana threatened to kill him anyway if he refused, so Kalanemi flew to the Himalayas and created an illusion: a beautiful ashram with a tranquil lake, where he sat disguised as a serene sage. When Hanuman arrived, exhausted and desperate, he saw the ashram and approached the "sage" for directions. Kalanemi welcomed him warmly, offered him food and rest, and suggested he bathe in the sacred lake first. But the lake was enchanted—a crocodile demon lurked within, ready to drag Hanuman under. When Hanuman entered the water, the crocodile attacked. Hanuman killed it instantly. The crocodile transformed into a beautiful apsara (celestial nymph) who had been cursed to that form. Freed, she revealed the truth: "This is no sage—this is the demon Kalanemi sent by Ravana to delay you until dawn!" Hanuman's eyes blazed with fury. He seized the false sage by the legs and whirled him around, smashing him to the ground. Then he continued his mission, ultimately lifting the entire mountain when he couldn't identify the specific herb. Lakshmana was saved. The story is used here as a metaphor: just as Kalanemi appeared holy but was pure deception, the Kali Yuga appears normal but is filled with hidden traps. And just as Hanuman saw through the disguise and destroyed it, the Name sees through all the illusions of this dark age.

Rama's Name is like the half-lion God who burst from a pillar. This dark age of Kali is like the demon king who thought he could never be killed. Those who chant the Name are like young Prahlada - the Name will protect them by destroying the demon of this evil age. Doha 27

Whether you chant with love or hate, with anger or laziness - chanting the Name brings blessings from all ten directions. Remembering this Name and bowing my head to Rama, I now begin to describe his glorious qualities. Chaupai 1

## The Poet's Humble Plea

Tulsidas expresses his unworthiness and his faith in Rama's grace.

He will set everything right for me in every way. His grace never gets tired of being gracious. What a master Rama is, and what a poor servant I am! Yet that ocean of mercy, looking at things from his own generous perspective, has taken care of me. Chaupai 2

In the world and in the scriptures, this is known as the way of a good master: he recognizes love just by hearing someone's humble words. Rich or poor, villager or city dweller, learned or foolish, disgraced or famous - Chaupai 3

Good poets and bad poets, all men and women, each according to their own understanding, praise the king. And a king who is saintly, wise, gentle, born from God's own essence, supremely kind - Chaupai 4

Such a king listens to everyone. He recognizes their words, their devotion, their humility, their sincerity. He honors everyone appropriately with sweet words. This is the nature of worldly kings. But the Lord of Kosala, Rama, is the wisest of all. Chaupai 5

Rama is pleased only by pure love. Who in this world is more foolish and impure-minded than me? Chaupai 6

Yet gracious Rama will surely honor the love and devotion of even this wicked servant. He made stones float like boats to build his bridge across the ocean. He made monkeys and bears into wise ministers. Doha 28(a)

Everyone calls me Rama's servant. I too let myself be called that without shame. Kind Rama bears this insult - that a master like him should have a servant like Tulsidas. Doha 28(b)

This is my great audacity and fault. Hearing of my sins, even hell wrinkles its nose in disgust - there is no place for me even there! Understanding this, I tremble with my own imagined fears. But Rama has never given even a dream's worth of attention to my faults. Chaupai 1

Instead, my Lord listened, watched, and examined my heart with his pure inner eye. He praised my devotion and understanding! What you say with your mouth may be flawed. But if goodness lives in your heart, that is what matters. In my heart I truly consider myself unworthy of being his servant - I see myself as a sinner, as lowly. This is the goodness within. Rama sees this state of his servant's heart and is pleased. Chaupai 2

The Lord does not remember the mistakes his devotees make. He remembers their heart's goodness a hundred times over. For the same sin that made Rama kill the monkey king Bali like a hunter shooting from hiding, Sugriva later did something similar. Sugriva forgot his promise to help Rama search for Sita, lost in his own pleasures. Chaupai 3

> **Story Referenced:**
>
> **Bali's Killing and Sugriva's Betrayal** — Bali was the powerful monkey king of Kishkindha and Sugriva's elder brother. A misunderstanding had turned them into enemies, and Bali had exiled Sugriva, taking his wife as well. When Sugriva allied with Rama, he asked for help defeating Bali. But Bali possessed a boon: whoever fought him face-to-face would lose half their strength to him, making him nearly invincible in direct combat.
>
> So Rama devised a controversial plan: Sugriva would challenge Bali to a duel, and while they fought, Rama would hide behind a tree and shoot Bali with an arrow. This is exactly what happened. When the dying Bali confronted Rama—"What kind of righteous king kills from hiding like a hunter?"—Rama gave several justifications. But the method remains debated to this day as morally ambiguous.
>
> After becoming king, Sugriva was supposed to immediately help Rama search for Sita. Instead, he became intoxicated with royal pleasures—wine, women, and comfort. Months passed. The rainy season came and went. Sugriva completely forgot his promise to his benefactor. This was arguably a worse betrayal than anything Bali had done.
>
> Yet Rama's response to each was completely different:
>
> | Figure | Sin | Rama's Response |
> |--------|-----|-----------------|
> | **Bali** | Took his brother's wife, persecuted Sugriva | Killed him |
> | **Sugriva** | Forgot his sacred promise, indulged in pleasures | Forgave him completely |
>
> The difference? Sugriva was Rama's devotee; Bali was not. Tulsidas uses this stark contrast to illustrate his point: God holds his devotees to a different standard, forgiving their failures while remembering their love "a hundred times over."

Vibhishana did something similar too - he betrayed his own brother, the demon king. But Rama never held this against him, not even in a dream. Instead, when Rama met his devoted brother Bharata, he honored Vibhishana publicly. In the royal court, Rama praised Vibhishana's virtues. Chaupai 4

The Lord stood beneath the trees while monkeys sat on the branches above him. Think about this: on one side, the Supreme Lord of all existence. On the other, monkeys jumping from branch to branch. Yet Rama made those very monkeys equal to himself. Tulsidas says: nowhere will you find a master as gracious and humble as Rama. Doha 29(a)

O Rama, through your goodness, everyone finds their good. If this is always true, then even Tulsidas will always be blessed. Doha 29(b)

In this way, having spoken of my own virtues and faults, and having bowed to everyone, I now describe the pure glory of Rama. Hearing it, all the sins of this dark age will be destroyed. Doha 29(c)
