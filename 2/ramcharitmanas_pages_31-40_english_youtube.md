## HOOK (First 30 Seconds)

```
[HOOK - 0:00-0:30]

When the gods and demons churned the cosmic ocean for the nectar
of immortality, something terrible came up first. A poison so deadly
it could destroy everything.

Shiva drank it. He should have died. Instead, it gave him immortality.

Today, Tulsidas tells us why. But before he reveals that secret,
he does something no spiritual master should do.

He calls himself a hypocrite. First among all the fakes.

Let's read.
```

## MAIN SCRIPT WITH FULL READING

```
[0:30-2:00]
[SECTION: The Poet's Honest Confession]

Tulsidas speaks about his own faults with striking honesty -
counting himself among hypocrites and pretenders.

[READ - SLOWER PACE]

"Some people are born in this terrible age of darkness.
Their actions are like crows but they dress like swans.

A swan is pure white and known for its ability to separate
milk from water. These people look holy but act selfishly.

They leave the path shown in the scriptures and walk on crooked roads.
They are living statues of deception.
They are vessels filled with the sins of this dark age."

[PAUSE - LET IT LAND]

"They cheat people while calling themselves devotees of Rama.
They are slaves to money, anger, and desire.
They push others around.
They wave false flags of religion.
They carry heavy loads of trickery.

Among all such people in this world, I count myself first."

[BRIEF COMMENTARY]
Pause on that. One of the most revered poets in Indian history -
placing himself at the front of the line of hypocrites.

[CONTINUE READING]

"If I were to list all my faults, the story would never end.
So I have mentioned only a few, dear friend.
The wise will understand from this small sample."

"Please understand my many requests.
After hearing my story, no one should find fault with it.
Anyone who still doubts after all this is even more foolish than me.
They are beggars when it comes to wisdom."

[2:00-3:30]

"I am not a poet. I am not called clever.
I simply sing Rama's qualities according to my small understanding.

On one side stands Rama's endless glory.
On the other stands my mind, tangled in worldly things.
What a mismatch!"

"When a wind is strong enough to carry away great mountains,
what chance does a piece of cotton have?
When I think of Rama's limitless greatness,
my heart trembles to write about him."

[DOHA - GIVE IT WEIGHT]

"Saraswati, the thousand-headed serpent who holds up the earth,
Shiva, the creator god, the scriptures, the Vedas, the old stories -
they all sing his praises endlessly.

And still they say 'Not this, not this' -
because they cannot capture his full glory with any words."

---

[3:30-5:30]
[SECTION: Why Sing of the Unspeakable]

Even though Rama's glory cannot be fully expressed,
everyone still tries - and the Vedas tell us why.

[READ]

"Everyone knows that the Lord's greatness cannot truly be spoken.
Yet no one has stayed silent.

The Vedas give the reason.
Singing God's praises has a power all its own.

No one can describe the full glory of God.
But everyone should praise him as much as they can.
Even a small song for God can carry a person
across the ocean of worldly troubles."

[BRIEF PAUSE]

"The Supreme Being is one.
He has no desires, no form, no name.
He was never born.
He is truth, awareness, and bliss.
He is the highest home.
He fills everything.
He is the form of the whole universe.

This same God took on a divine body
and played out many stories for us to hear."

"He did this only for the sake of his devotees.
He is supremely kind.
He loves those who come to him for shelter.
He has deep affection and tenderness for his people.
Once he shows mercy to someone,
he never grows angry with them again."

[READ WITH WARMTH]

"Lord Rama restores what is lost.
He uplifts the poor.
He is simple in nature.
He is all-powerful.
He is everyone's master.

Knowing this, wise people sing his glory.
By doing so, they make their speech sacred.
Their words bear the sweetest fruit -
freedom from bondage and the rare gift of divine love."

"With this understanding as my strength,
I will bow my head at Rama's feet and tell his story.
Great sages told God's glory before me.
Walking on that same path will be easy for me, brother."

---

[5:30-7:30]
[SECTION: The Bridge of the Ancient Poets]

The poet explains how he will cross the vast river of Rama's story
by walking on the bridge built by earlier masters.

[DOHA - BEAUTIFUL IMAGE]

"When a king builds a bridge over great rivers,
even the tiniest ants can cross without any effort.

In the same way, because earlier sages have written about Rama,
even I can tell his story with ease."

[CONTINUE]

"Giving my mind this courage,
I will compose this beautiful tale of Rama.
Sage Vyasa and many other great poets
have lovingly told God's story before me."

"I bow at the lotus feet of all those great poets.
May they fulfill all my wishes.
I also bow to the poets of this dark age
who have described Rama's many virtues."

"I bow to all the wise folk poets
who told God's story in everyday language.
Those who came before, those who are alive now,
and those who will come in the future -
I bow to all of them with all deception cast aside."

[READ WITH SINCERITY]

"Please be happy with me.
Grant me this blessing -
that good people will honor my poetry.

Poetry that wise people do not respect is created in vain.
Only foolish poets waste their effort on such work."

"Fame, poetry, and wealth are truly good
only when they help everyone,
like the Ganga helps all who come to her.

Rama's fame is infinitely beautiful and beneficial.
But my poetry is rough.
This mismatch worries me deeply."

"Yet with your blessings, dear poets,
even this becomes possible for me.
Fine silk stitching looks beautiful even on rough burlap cloth."

[DOHAS - SERIES OF THREE]

"Wise people honor poetry that is simple
and tells of pure character.
They honor poetry that makes even enemies
forget their hatred and offer praise."

"Such poetry cannot exist without a pure mind.
My mental strength is very small.
So I plead again and again -
dear poets, please be kind.
Help me sing God's glory."

"O poets and scholars!
You are the beautiful swans of the Manasarovar lake
of Rama's story.

A swan can drink milk and leave the water behind.
You can find beauty even in imperfect words.

Please hear this child's prayer.
See my sincere intentions.
Be kind to me."

---

[7:30-9:30]
[SECTION: Bowing to the First Poet and the Sacred Books]

The poet honors Valmiki, the Vedas, and the creator god
with deep reverence.

[STORY - HIGH RETENTION - READ WITH DRAMA]

"I bow at the lotus feet of the sage who wrote the first Ramayana.

This poet was once a highway robber.

One day he met some great sages in the forest.
They saw something in him and tried to teach him Rama's name.

But his tongue was so accustomed to violence
that he could not say 'Rama.'

So they told him to say 'Mara' instead - the word for death.

He sat repeating 'Mara, Mara, Mara' over and over.

Say it fast enough and 'Mara Mara' becomes 'Rama Rama.'

The name worked its magic even spoken backwards.

He sat so still in meditation that an anthill grew over him.

When he emerged years later, he was completely transformed.

The robber had become Valmiki, the first poet -
his very name meaning 'one born from an anthill.'

His Ramayana includes the demons Khara and Dushana,
yet it is soft and beautiful, not harsh.
Though it contains Dushana by name,
it contains no dushana - no fault at all."

[CONTINUE READING]

"I bow to the four Vedas.
They are like ships that carry us across the ocean of worldly life.
They never grow tired of singing Rama's pure glory,
not even in their dreams."

"I bow to the dust of the creator god's feet.
He made this ocean of existence.

When the gods and demons churned the cosmic ocean long ago,
many wonders emerged.

From it came saints who are like nectar,
the moon, and the wish-fulfilling cow.

From it also came wicked people
who are like poison and wine."

"I bow at the feet of the gods, the holy teachers,
the learned ones, and the planets.
With folded hands I ask them to be pleased with me
and fulfill all my good wishes."

---

[9:30-11:30]
[SECTION: Honoring Saraswati, Ganga, and the Divine Parents]

The poet bows to the sacred rivers
and to Shiva and Parvati, who are his spiritual parents.

[READ]

"Now I bow to Saraswati and to Ganga, the river of heaven.
Both are pure. Both have beautiful ways.

Ganga washes away sins when you bathe in her or drink her water.
Saraswati removes ignorance when you speak or hear
words of truth and praise."

"I bow to Shiva and Parvati.
They are my teacher, my father, and my mother.
They are friends to the poor.
They give constantly.

They are Rama's servants, masters, and friends all at once.

They help me, Tulsidas, in every way with complete sincerity."

[INTERESTING DETAIL]

"Seeing the troubles of this dark age,
Shiva and Parvati created simple folk mantras
for the good of all people.

These mantras have strange letters.
They have no clear meaning.
They cannot be chanted in the usual way.

Yet by Shiva's power, their effect is plain to see."

"May that same Shiva be kind to me.
May he make this story a source of joy and blessings.

Remembering Parvati and Shiva, receiving their grace,
I describe Rama's story with an eager heart."

"By Shiva's blessing, my poetry will shine
like the night sky bright with moon and stars.

Those who tell or hear this story with love, care, and attention
will become lovers of Rama's feet.
They will be free from the stains of this dark age.
They will receive beautiful blessings."

[DOHA]

"If Shiva and Parvati truly look upon me with favor, even in dreams,
then may everything I have said about the power of this poetry
come true."

---

[11:30-14:00]
[SECTION: Bowing to Ayodhya and the Holy Family]

The poet honors the sacred city, its river,
and the royal family who brought Rama into the world.

[READ]

"I bow to the most sacred city of Ayodhya.
I bow to the Sarayu river that destroys the sins of this dark age.
I bow to the men and women of that city,
for whom Rama felt deep love."

[PAUSE - IMPORTANT CONTEXT]

This verse alludes to a painful story from later in the Ramayana.

After Rama and Sita returned home victorious,
a washerman in the city questioned Sita's purity -
she had lived in the demon king's palace for months, after all.

Rama overheard this gossip one night while walking in disguise.

Though he knew Sita was innocent,
he felt a king must be beyond all suspicion.

So he sent his pregnant wife to live in the forest,
where she raised their twin sons alone.

It remains the most debated episode in the epic -
was it supreme duty or terrible injustice?

Tulsidas does not tell this story in his Ramcharitmanas,
ending instead at the happy coronation.

But here he offers a redemptive note:
even those who slandered Sita received Rama's grace.
He destroyed their sins and gave them a place in his divine realm.

[CONTINUE READING]

"I bow to Queen Kaushalya, who is like the eastern horizon.
Her fame spreads through all the world.

From her, like a beautiful moon rising in the east,
appeared Rama - who gives joy to the universe
and who is like frost to the lotuses of wicked people.

When frost comes, lotuses close up and wilt.
In the same way, Rama's presence makes evil shrink back."

"I bow in thought, word, and deed
to King Dasharatha and all his queens.

I see them as living forms of virtue and beautiful blessing.
May they be kind to me, knowing I am their son's servant.

Even the creator god gained glory by creating them.
They are the very limit of greatness
because they became Rama's mother and father."

[SORATHA - EMOTIONAL]

"I bow to King Dasharatha of Ayodhya.
His love for Rama's feet was true and deep.

When his kind Lord left for the forest,
Dasharatha gave up his beloved body
as easily as discarding a blade of grass.

He simply could not live without Rama."

---

[14:00-16:00]
[SECTION: Bowing to King Janaka and the Brothers]

The poet honors Sita's father and Rama's three devoted brothers.

[READ]

"I bow to King Janaka along with all his family.

He had a hidden love for Rama's feet.
He kept this love secret
whether he was meditating like a yogi
or enjoying life like a king.

But the moment he saw Rama,
that secret love burst into the open for all to see."

"Among all the brothers, I first bow at the feet of Bharat.

His vows and disciplines cannot be described in words.
His mind clings to Rama's lotus feet
like a bee drunk on nectar.

A bee that finds the sweetest flower never wants to leave.
Bharat never left Rama's feet, not even in thought."

"I bow to the lotus feet of Lakshman.
They are cool, beautiful, and give happiness to devotees.

The pure flag of Rama's glory flies high because of him.
Lakshman's fame is like the pole
that holds that flag up for all to see."

"Lakshman is the thousand-headed serpent
who holds up the entire world.
He took birth on earth to remove its burden of fear.

May that ocean of mercy, that treasure of virtues,
son of Sumitra, always be pleased with me."

"I bow to the lotus feet of Shatrughna,
who is brave, gentle, and follows Bharat everywhere.

I pray to the great hero Hanuman,
whose glory Rama himself described with his own mouth."

---

[16:00-17:00]
[SECTION: Bowing to Hanuman and All Devotees]

The poet honors the mighty monkey
and all beings who serve Rama selflessly.

[SORATHA - POWERFUL IMAGE]

"I bow to Hanuman, the son of the Wind.

He is like fire to the forest of wicked people -
he burns away all evil.

He is a dense cloud of wisdom.

In the temple of his heart lives Rama,
holding his bow and arrows."

[READ]

"Sugriva the monkey king,
the old bear king who was named Jambavan,
the demon king Vibhishana who left his wicked brother to serve Rama,
young Angad, and all the other monkeys -
I bow at all their beautiful feet.

Though they had lowly bodies as animals and demons,
they still reached Rama."

"All those who worship Rama's feet -
whether bird, beast, god, human, or demon -
I bow at all their lotus feet.

I honor those who serve Rama without any selfish desire."

"The young sage Shukadeva,
the four child-sages called the Sanakadis,
the wandering saint Narada,
and all the great sages who are masters of divine knowledge -
I bow to them all, touching my forehead to the ground.

O great sages, please know me as your servant
and be kind to me."

---

[17:00-18:30]
[SECTION: Bowing to Sita and Rama]

The poet's prayers reach their highest point
as he bows to the Divine Mother and Lord.

[READ WITH REVERENCE]

"I honor the two lotus feet of Sita,
daughter of King Janaka,
mother of the world,
and dearest to Rama who is the ocean of compassion.

By her grace may I receive a pure mind."

"Then with mind, speech, and action,
I bow at the all-capable lotus feet of Lord Rama.

His eyes are like lotus petals.
He carries his bow and arrows.
He destroys the troubles of his devotees and gives them joy."

[DOHA - PROFOUND]

"Words and their meaning seem different but are really one.
Water and waves seem different but are really one.

In the same way, Sita and Rama appear as two but are truly one.

I bow at their feet.
The sad and suffering are dearest to them."

---

[18:30-23:00]
[SECTION: The Glory of Rama's Name]

The poet now bows to the sacred name itself -
revealing its cosmic origins and transforming power.

[READ - THIS IS THE PAYOFF FROM THE HOOK]

"I bow to the name 'Rama' of the Lord.

This name is the seed of fire, sun, and moon.

The letter 'Ra' is the seed of fire.
The letter 'A' is the seed of the sun.
The letter 'Ma' is the seed of the moon.

This name contains the creator, the preserver, and the transformer.
It is the life-breath of the Vedas.
It is beyond all qualities yet it is a treasure-house of all qualities."

"This is the great mantra that Shiva himself chants.

In the holy city of Kashi,
Shiva whispers this name into the ear of every dying person,
and that person gains freedom.

Ganesha knows the power of this name.
It is because of this name's power
that Ganesha is worshipped first before any other god."

[CALLBACK TO VALMIKI]

"The first poet knew the power of this name.
He was purified by chanting it backwards.

He could not say 'Rama' properly,
so he said 'Mara, Mara' - which is 'Rama' reversed.

Even chanted backwards, the name transformed him completely.

Parvati heard Shiva say that one utterance of 'Rama'
equals a thousand other divine names.

Since then she always chants the name alongside her husband."

[THE POISON STORY - HOOK PAYOFF]

"Seeing Parvati's deep love for the name, Shiva was overjoyed.
He made her, the jewel among devoted wives, his own ornament.
He took her onto his own body, making her his other half.

Shiva knows the name's power well.

When the gods and demons churned the cosmic ocean,
a terrible poison emerged that threatened to destroy everything.

Shiva drank it to save the world.

The poison that should have killed him
gave him the gift of immortal life instead.

All because of the power of Rama's name."

[DOHA]

"Devotion to Rama is like the rainy season.
Good servants are like rice paddies waiting to grow.

Tulsidas says the two beautiful letters of 'Rama'
are like the months of monsoon - Savan and Bhadon.

Just as rain makes the rice grow tall,
the name makes devotion flourish in the heart."

[CONTINUE - BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTIONS]

"The name 'Rama' has just two letters.
They are sweet. They are beautiful.

These two letters are like the eyes of the alphabet.
They are the life of all who love God.

They are easy to remember.
They bring joy to everyone.
They give you success in this world.
They take care of you in the next world too."

"These two letters are wonderful to say, to hear, and to remember.

Tulsidas loves them as dearly as Rama loves his brother Lakshmana.

When you look at each letter separately, they seem different.
But together they are one,
just as the soul and God are one."

"These two letters are like two beautiful brothers.
They protect the world.
They especially protect those who love God.

They are like earrings on the ears of a beautiful woman called Devotion.

For the good of the world,
they shine like the pure moon and the sun."

"These two letters are like tasting nectar and feeling satisfied.

Like the great turtle and the thousand-headed serpent who hold up the earth,
they hold up everything.

Long ago, when gods and demons churned the ocean for treasure,
a turtle held the churning rod steady from below,
and a great serpent wound around the rod as a rope.

These two letters hold up our world just like that.

They are like bees playing in the lotus flower of a devotee's heart.
They are like Krishna and his brother Balarama
bringing joy to their mother."

[FINAL DOHA - END ON BEAUTY]

"Tulsidas makes a beautiful observation
about how 'Rama' looks when written.

Look at the two letters of Rama's name when written in our script.

The letter 'Ra' has a curved mark that sits above other letters
like a royal canopy sheltering them from the sun.

The letter 'Ma' wears a dot on top like a jewel in a crown.

These two letters look like kings!
They rule over all the other letters of the alphabet."
```

---

## END SCREEN

```
[23:00-24:00]

So that's where we are.

Tulsidas has confessed his limitations.
He's bowed to every poet who came before.
He's honored the sacred rivers, the gods, the royal family.
And he's revealed the secret Shiva knew -
why two simple letters hold cosmic power.

Tomorrow, we finally enter the story itself.

We'll meet two gatekeepers who stood at the doors of heaven
and made a choice that echoed through lifetimes.

Their curse becomes everything that follows.

If you want to continue this journey with me, subscribe.
I'll see you tomorrow.
