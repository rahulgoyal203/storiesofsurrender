## Simple English Translation

## The Poet's Humble Beginning
Tulsidas explains how he came to tell this story, tracing it through a chain of great teachers.

After describing my own strengths and weaknesses, and bowing my head to everyone once more, I now tell the pure glory of Rama. Just hearing it destroys the sins of this dark age. Doha 29(c)

There is a beautiful story that the sage Yajnavalkya once told to the great sage Bharadwaj. I will tell that same story now. May all good people listen with joy. Chaupai 1

Shiva first composed this beautiful tale. Then, out of kindness, he told it to Parvati. The crow-saint Kakbhushundi was a great devotee of Rama. Shiva recognized his worthiness and gave the story to him. Kakbhushundi was no ordinary crow - he was a wise soul who had lived for many ages and loved Rama with all his heart. Chaupai 2

From Kakbhushundi, the sage Yajnavalkya received this story. Then he sang it to the sage Bharadwaj. Both the teller and the listener were equals in goodness. Both saw all beings with equal eyes. Both understood the play of God. Chaupai 3

Through their own knowledge, they see past, present, and future as clearly as a gooseberry sitting in their palm. And other wise devotees of God also speak, hear, and understand this story in many ways. Chaupai 4

## The Poet's Childhood Ignorance
Tulsidas shares how he first heard this story as a child and could not understand it.

I also heard this story from my teacher at a sacred place. But I was just a child then, completely ignorant. I did not understand it properly. Doha 30(a)

The tellers and listeners of Rama's deep story are treasures of wisdom. How could I, a foolish soul trapped in the sins of this dark age, understand such things? Doha 30(b)

## Learning Through Repetition
How the poet finally understood through his teacher's patience.

Yet my teacher told the story again and again. Slowly, according to my small mind, some understanding came. Now I will put that same story into simple language. This will bring peace to my own heart. Chaupai 1

Whatever little wisdom and understanding I have, I will use it. God himself guides my heart. I am creating this story to remove my own doubts, ignorance, and confusion. It is like a boat to cross the river of worldly existence. Chaupai 2

## The Glory of Rama's Story
Tulsidas describes the many blessings that come from hearing Rama's story.

Rama's story gives rest to scholars. It makes all people happy. It destroys the sins of this dark age. Chaupai 3

This dark age is like a poisonous snake. Rama's story is like a peacock that eats that snake. A peacock hunts and kills snakes fearlessly. In the same way, this story destroys the poison of our troubled times. This story is also like the wooden churning stick that creates the fire of wisdom. Chaupai 3

In this dark age, Rama's story is like the wish-fulfilling cow that grants all desires. For good people, it is like the magical herb that brings the dead back to life. On earth, it is the river of nectar. It destroys the fear of birth and death. It is a serpent that swallows the frogs of confusion. Chaupai 4

Like a great army against demons, this story destroys hells. Like Parvati, the goddess of strength, it protects the family of saints. For the ocean of saints, it is like Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty and wealth. Like the earth itself, it carries the weight of the whole world without complaint. Chaupai 5

It is like the river Yamuna, putting soot on the faces of death's messengers. They come to take souls away, but this story defeats them. It is like Kashi, the holy city where all who die are freed. Rama loves this story like he loves the sacred basil plant. For Tulsidas, this story is like his own mother, caring for his heart. Chaupai 6

Shiva loves this story like he loves the river Narmada. It is the treasure-house of all success, happiness, and wealth. Like the mother of gods, it gives birth to all good qualities. It is the highest limit of devotion and love for Rama. Chaupai 7

## The Lake of Rama's Story
A beautiful extended metaphor comparing the Ramcharitmanas to a sacred lake.

Tulsidas says this: Rama's story is the Mandakini river. A pure heart is the mountain Chitrakoot. Beautiful love is the forest. In that forest, Sita and Rama wander happily. Doha 31

The story of Rama is a beautiful wish-fulfilling gem. It is lovely jewelry for the wise mind of a saint. The collection of Rama's virtues brings good fortune to the world. They give liberation, wealth, righteousness, and the highest heaven. Chaupai 1

For gaining knowledge, detachment, and yoga, these virtues are the perfect teacher. For curing the terrible disease of worldly existence, they are like the divine doctors of heaven. They are the mother and father who give birth to love for Sita and Rama. They are the seeds of all vows, duties, and spiritual practices. Chaupai 2

They destroy sin, suffering, and sorrow. They lovingly protect us in this world and the next. They are the brave ministers and soldiers of King Wisdom. Like the great sage who once drank the entire ocean, they drink up the endless ocean of greed. Chaupai 3

In the forest of a devotee's mind live elephants of lust, anger, and the sins of this dark age. The virtues of Rama are like young lions that kill those elephants. They are Shiva's most beloved and honored guests. For the forest fire of poverty, they are rain clouds that bring what we desire. Chaupai 4

Against the snake of worldly attachments, they are the healing mantra and the precious jewel that cures poison. They can erase even the bad fortune written on our foreheads - those stubborn lines that are so hard to remove. Like the rays of the sun, they scatter the darkness of ignorance. Like rain clouds, they nourish the rice crop of devotees. Chaupai 5

Like the wish-fulfilling tree, they give whatever the heart desires. Like Vishnu and Shiva, they are easy to please and they give happiness. For good poets, they are like stars decorating the autumn sky of the mind. For Rama's devotees, they are life itself. Chaupai 6

They are like the great enjoyments that come from all good deeds. Like true saints, they help the world without any selfish motive. For the hearts of devotees, which are like the sacred Manasarovar lake, they are like swans. For purifying souls, they are like the waves of the Ganga. Chaupai 7

## The Cleansing Fire of Rama's Virtues
How Rama's story burns away the evils of this dark age.

Rama's collection of virtues is like a fierce fire. It burns the wrong paths, twisted arguments, evil ways, deceit, pride, and hypocrisy of this dark age - just as fire burns fuel. Doha 32(a)

Rama's story is like the rays of the full moon. It gives happiness to everyone. But for the lotus-like hearts of good people and the chakora birds of their minds, it brings special benefit and great profit. The chakora is a bird that drinks only moonlight - it lives on nothing else. Good souls are like that bird, finding all their nourishment in Rama's story. Doha 32(b)

## The Four Conversations
Tulsidas explains the structure of the text - four beautiful dialogues that frame the story.

I will tell how Parvati asked her question to Shiva. I will tell how Shiva answered in detail. All of this I will sing, creating a wonderful story. Chaupai 1

If anyone has not heard this story before, let them not be surprised by it. Wise people who hear this extraordinary tale feel no surprise. They know in their hearts that Rama's story has no limits in this world. Rama has taken birth in many forms. There are countless Ramayanas - a hundred crore and more. Chaupai 2-3

In different cosmic ages, the sages have sung the beautiful deeds of God in different ways. Keeping this in your heart, do not doubt. Listen to this story with respect and love. Chaupai 4

Rama is endless. His virtues are endless. The spread of his stories is endless. Those whose thinking is pure will not be surprised when they hear this. Doha 33

## The Poet's Final Prayer Before Beginning
Tulsidas clears all doubts and prepares to tell the story.

In this way, I clear away all doubts. I place the dust of my teacher's lotus feet upon my head. With folded hands, I pray to everyone that no fault may touch this story. Chaupai 1

Now, bowing my head with respect to Shiva, I will tell the pure tale of Rama's virtues. In the year 1631, with my head at God's feet, I begin this story. Chaupai 2

It was the ninth day of the spring month of Chaitra, a Tuesday. In the city of Ayodhya, this story came to light. The scriptures say that on the day Rama was born, all the sacred places travel there. Chaupai 3

Demons, serpents, birds, humans, sages, and gods - all come to Ayodhya to serve Rama. Wise people celebrate his birth festival. They sing the beautiful glory of Rama. Chaupai 4

## The Sacred River Saryu
The holiness of Rama's birthplace.

Many groups of good people bathe in the holy waters of the river Saryu that day. They hold Rama's beautiful dark form in their hearts and chant his name. Doha 34

The scriptures say that just seeing, touching, bathing in, or drinking the Saryu's water removes sins. This river is extremely sacred. Its glory is endless. Even Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom, cannot describe it fully. Chaupai 1

This beautiful city of Ayodhya leads souls to Rama's highest heaven. It is known throughout all worlds as extremely holy. There are countless living beings born in four ways - from eggs, from sweat, from seeds, and from wombs. Any of them who leave their body in Ayodhya never return to this world again. They are freed from the wheel of birth and death. Chaupai 2

Knowing this city to be delightful in every way, the giver of all success and the mine of blessings, I began this pure story. Hearing it destroys lust, pride, and hypocrisy. Chaupai 3

## The Naming of the Ramcharitmanas
Why this text is called "The Lake of Rama's Deeds."

Its name is Ramcharitmanas. Just hearing it through the ears brings peace. The mind is like an elephant burning in the forest fire of worldly desires. If that elephant falls into this lake called Ramcharitmanas, it finds happiness. Chaupai 4

This Ramcharitmanas is dear to sages. Shiva composed this beautiful and pure lake. It destroys the three kinds of faults, all sorrows, and poverty. It removes the bad ways and all sins of this dark age. Chaupai 5

After composing it, the great Shiva kept it in his own mind. When the right moment came, he told it to Parvati. Seeing it in his heart and feeling happy, Shiva gave it the beautiful name "Ramcharitmanas." Chaupai 6

I will now tell that delightful and happy-making story of Rama. O good people, listen with respect and attention. Chaupai 7

Now I will tell how this Ramcharitmanas came to be, how it was made, and why it spread through the world. I tell all this after remembering Parvati and Shiva. Doha 35

## The Lake and Its Features
An extended metaphor describing every element of the text as part of a sacred lake.

By Shiva's grace, beautiful understanding blossomed in the heart. That is how this Tulsidas became the poet of Ramcharitmanas. According to my small mind, I make it as beautiful as I can. But O good people, please listen with pure hearts and correct whatever needs correcting. Chaupai 1

Good understanding is the land. The deep place in that land is the heart. The scriptures are the ocean. Saints are the clouds. They rain down the beautiful, sweet, and blessing-giving water of Rama's fame. Chaupai 2

When storytellers describe Rama's divine play in detail, that is the purity of this water, which washes away all dirt. The loving devotion that cannot be put into words - that is the sweetness and beautiful coolness of this water. Chaupai 3

This water helps the rice-crop of good deeds to grow. For Rama's devotees, it is life itself. This sacred water falls on the earth of the mind, gathers, and flows through the lovely path of the ears. It fills the lake of the heart and settles there. Growing old, it becomes beautiful, pleasing, cool, and delightful. Chaupai 4-5

In this story, four very beautiful and excellent conversations have been thoughtfully composed. They are the four charming bathing places of this pure and lovely lake. The four conversations are: between the crow-saint and the eagle Garuda, between Shiva and Parvati, between the sage Yajnavalkya and the sage Bharadwaj, and between Tulsidas and the saints. Doha 36

The seven chapters are the seven beautiful steps going down into this lake. When you see them with the eyes of wisdom, the mind becomes happy. The glory of Rama, which is beyond worldly qualities and unlimited - that description is the fathomless depth of this beautiful water. Chaupai 1

The fame of Rama and Sita is nectar-like water. The comparisons I use are the playful, delightful waves. The beautiful four-line verses are the thick lotus plants. The poetic techniques are the lovely oysters that produce beautiful pearls. Chaupai 2

The lovely meters, couplets, and dohas are groups of colorful lotuses adorning the lake. The matchless meanings, the elevated feelings, and the beautiful language - these are the pollen, the sweet nectar, and the fragrance. Chaupai 3

Heaps of good deeds are like beautiful rows of bees. Knowledge, detachment, and contemplation are the swans. The sounds of poetry - its subtleties, its qualities, its types - these are the many kinds of beautiful fish. Chaupai 4

The discussion of the four goals of life - wealth, righteousness, pleasure, and liberation - along with wisdom and higher knowledge, the nine moods of poetry, chanting, austerity, yoga, and detachment - all these are the beautiful aquatic creatures of this lake. Chaupai 5

The singing of virtuous souls, of saints, and of Rama's holy name - these are like colorful water-birds. The gatherings of saints are like mango groves surrounding the lake on all sides. Faith is described as being like the spring season. Chaupai 6

The various descriptions of devotion, along with forgiveness, mercy, and self-control, are the canopies of vines. Peace, the restraints, and the observances are the flowers. Knowledge is the fruit. Love for God's feet is the juice of that fruit. So say the scriptures. Chaupai 7

And the many other stories and episodes in this text are like parrots, cuckoos, and other colorful birds. Chaupai 8

The goosebumps that rise while hearing this story - they are the gardens, orchards, and forests. The happiness felt is the play of beautiful birds. The pure mind is the gardener who waters them through lovely eyes with the water of love. Doha 37

## Who Can Approach This Lake
Why some people stay away from this sacred story.

Those who carefully sing this story are the clever guardians of this lake. The men and women who always listen with respect - they are the worthy gods who deserve to enjoy this beautiful lake. Chaupai 1

But those who are very wicked and lost in worldly pleasures - they are unfortunate crows and herons who do not come near this lake. Why? Because there are no snails, frogs, or algae here. There are no tales of worldly pleasures here. Chaupai 2

Crows and herons eat dirty things - snails, frogs, dead things. They have no interest in clear, pure water. In the same way, people addicted to worldly pleasures find nothing for them in this story.

For this reason, the poor crows and herons of lust turn back in their hearts, defeated. Coming to this lake is very difficult. Without Rama's grace, one cannot reach it. Chaupai 3

## The Obstacles on the Path
What makes the journey to this sacred lake so difficult.

Bad company is the terrible, dangerous road. The words of bad companions are tigers, lions, and snakes. The work of the house and the many tangles of family life - these are huge, impassable mountains. Chaupai 4

Delusion, pride, and ego are many wild, dangerous forests. All kinds of twisted arguments are terrifying rivers. Chaupai 5

Those who lack faith as their provision for the journey, who do not have the company of saints, and who do not love Rama - for them this lake is completely unreachable. Doha 38

Even if someone struggles hard and reaches this place, the moment they arrive, drowsiness and cold overtake them. The terrible cold of dullness grips their heart. Though they have come, the unfortunate ones cannot bathe. Chaupai
