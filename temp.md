## Simple English Translation

# Opening Prayers
The poet begins by honoring the gods, his teachers, and the divine couple whose story he will tell.

### Shloka 1
I bow to Saraswati, the goddess of speech, and to Ganesha, the elephant-headed god. They give us words. They give us meaning. They give us poetry and song. All good things come from them.

### Shloka 2
I bow to Shiva and Parvati. They are faith and trust in living form. Without these two things, even the greatest seekers cannot find God in their own hearts.

### Shloka 3
I bow to my teacher, who is pure wisdom. Look at the moon - it is crooked and incomplete. Long ago, the moon was cursed to fade away forever. He ran to Shiva for help, and Shiva placed him on his own head. Now the whole world worships that same flawed moon. When you have a great teacher, even your flaws become beautiful.

### Shloka 4
I bow to the first poet who wrote Rama's story and to Hanuman, the great monkey. The poet was once a highway robber. One day he met some sages, and they taught him to repeat Rama's name. He sat so still in meditation that an anthill grew over him. When he emerged, he was transformed - the robber had become the greatest poet. Hanuman too gave his whole life to Rama. Both are wise. Both love to walk through the garden of Sita and Rama's goodness.

### Shloka 5
I bow to Sita, Rama's beloved. She creates the world. She keeps it running. She ends it when the time comes. She removes suffering. She gives blessings. I touch her feet with respect.

### Shloka 6
Everything moves by his power - the whole world, all the gods, all the demons. Because he is real, this world seems real - like when you see a rope in the dark and think it's a snake. For anyone who wants to cross the ocean of life and death, his feet are the only boat. I bow to that God whose name is Rama.

### Shloka 7
What the old books say, what the holy texts teach, what the Ramayana tells - Tulsidas now writes all of this in simple language. He does it for the joy of his own heart. This is the story of Lord Rama.

# Calling Upon the Gods
Short prayers asking different forms of the divine for their blessing.

### Soratha 1
When you remember him, things work out. He leads all the heavenly helpers. He has an elephant's face. He is full of wisdom and goodness. May Ganesha bless me.

### Soratha 2
His grace can make a silent person speak beautifully. His grace can help a lame person climb the highest mountain. He burns away all the troubles of this dark age. May that kind one look at me with love.

### Soratha 3
He is dark blue like a lotus. His eyes are red like blooming flowers. He rests forever on the ocean of milk, where the gods churned out nectar long ago. May that Lord live in my heart.

### Soratha 4
His body is white like jasmine and moonlight. He is Parvati's husband. He is full of kindness. He loves the humble. Once, the god of love tried to disturb his meditation by shooting arrows of desire. Shiva opened his third eye and burned him to ash. Yet even after that, Shiva remained gentle. May he bless me.

# Praise of the Teacher
The poet honors his guru, whose grace makes everything possible.

### Soratha 5
I bow to my teacher's feet. He is an ocean of mercy. He is God in human form. His words are like sunlight that cuts through the deepest darkness of confusion.

### Chaupai 1
I bow to the dust on my teacher's feet. That dust is sweet. It smells wonderful. It is full of love. It is like medicine made from a magical plant that cures all the diseases of worldly life.

### Chaupai 2
That dust is like the holy ash on Shiva's body. It brings joy and blessings. It cleans the mirror of a devotee's mind. When you put it on your forehead, all good qualities come to you.

### Chaupai 3
The light from my teacher's toenails shines like gems. When you remember it, you start to see things clearly. That light destroys the darkness of ignorance. If it enters your heart, you are truly lucky.

### Chaupai 4
When that light comes in, your inner eyes open. The sorrows of this world disappear. Then you start seeing Rama's story everywhere - like finding jewels hidden in different places.

### Doha 1
Wise people use a special paste on their eyes. Then they can see treasures hidden under mountains and forests. The teacher's grace works the same way.

### Chaupai 5
The dust from my teacher's feet is like that special eye paste. It is soft and beautiful. It heals the eyes. It helps me see clearly. Now I will tell Rama's story that sets people free.

### Chaupai 6
First I bow to the holy men, the teachers of the earth. They remove all doubts born from not knowing. Then I bow with love to all good people. They are full of every good quality.

# The Power of Good Company
Tulsidas explains why being around saints and good people is the root of all blessings.

### Chaupai 7
A saint's life is like a cotton plant. The fruit of cotton has no taste. It is plain and white. But it is full of useful threads. The saint suffers himself but hides the faults of others. That is why the world respects him.

### Chaupai 8
The company of saints is full of joy and blessings. It is like a walking holy place where sacred rivers meet - the holiest spot in all of India. In this holy place, love for Rama flows like the Ganga. Thinking about truth flows like another sacred river.

### Chaupai 9
Stories about what to do and what not to do flow like the Yamuna river. They wash away the sins of this dark age. Stories of Vishnu and Shiva come together like the Ganga, Yamuna, and a hidden third river meeting at one sacred spot. Hearing them gives happiness and blessings.

### Chaupai 10
In this saintly gathering, firm faith is like an ancient tree that never dies. Good actions are the helpers of this holy place. This place is open to everyone, everywhere, at all times. When you serve it with respect, your troubles go away.

### Chaupai 11
This holy gathering is beyond words. It gives results right away. You can see its power yourself.

### Doha 2
People who hear about this saintly gathering with a happy heart, who understand it, who dive into it with love - they get everything good in life, even while still alive.

### Chaupai 12
The result of being with saints shows immediately. Crows become sweet-singing birds. Ugly birds become beautiful swans. Don't be surprised. The power of good company is no secret.

### Chaupai 13
Great sages have told their own life stories. The first poet was a robber who found peace. The wandering saint travels the universe forever, spreading wisdom wherever he goes. The wise hermit once drank the entire ocean to help the gods defeat some demons hiding underwater. Each was transformed by good company. Think of all the creatures in the world - those in water, on land, in the sky, whether they can think or not.

### Chaupai 14
Whoever got wisdom, fame, a good life, wealth, or goodness - anywhere, anytime, by any method - it all came from good company. There is no other way. The holy books say so. Common sense says so.

### Chaupai 15
Without good company, you cannot learn right from wrong. And without Rama's blessing, you don't easily find good company. Good company is the root of all joy and blessings. Finding it is the real reward. Everything else is just flowers on the way to the fruit.

### Chaupai 16
Even bad people become good when they find saintly company. Iron becomes gold when it touches the magic stone. But if a good person ends up in bad company by accident, he still keeps his own nature. Old stories say cobras carry a glowing jewel on their heads. That jewel stays bright even though the snake is poisonous. Good people are like that jewel.

### Chaupai 17
Even the creator god, Vishnu, Shiva, and the wisest poets hesitate to describe how wonderful saints are. How can I do it? It would be like a vegetable seller trying to explain precious diamonds.

### Doha 3a
I bow to saints whose minds are balanced. They have no friends or enemies. They are like flowers held in cupped hands - the hand that plucked them and the hand that received them both smell sweet. Saints bless everyone equally, whether friend or stranger.

### Doha 3b
Saints have simple hearts. They want good for the whole world. Knowing their loving nature, I make a small request: Please hear my childish prayer and give me love for Rama's feet.

# On Bad People
A surprisingly honest look at those who cause harm. Tulsidas bows even to them - partly out of humility, partly with sharp wit.

### Chaupai 18
Now I bow honestly even to bad people. They work against even those who help them, for no reason. They think hurting others is profit. They are happy when others fail. They are sad when others succeed.

### Chaupai 19
They try to block the good name of God like the eclipse demon blocking the moon. They are warriors when it comes to harming others. They look for other people's faults with a thousand eyes. Their minds are like flies that spoil good food and die in the process.

### Chaupai 20
They burn like fire. They get angry like the god of death. They are rich in sins and faults, like the god of wealth is rich in gold. When they rise up, it means trouble for everyone - like a bad star in the sky. Like a demon who sleeps for months, it's best when they stay asleep.

### Chaupai 21
They will destroy themselves just to hurt someone else - like hailstones that ruin crops and then melt away. I bow to them as if they were the thousand-headed serpent - because they speak of other people's faults with many mouths and much anger.

### Chaupai 22
I bow to them as if they were an ancient king who wanted ten thousand ears to hear God's glory - because they listen to gossip and scandal with ten thousand ears. I bow to them as if they were the king of gods - because they love things that harm them.

### Chaupai 23
Harsh words are their favorite weapon. They watch for other people's mistakes with a thousand eyes.

### Doha 4
Bad people burn with jealousy when they hear good things about anyone - stranger, enemy, or friend, it doesn't matter. Knowing this, I fold both my hands and make a loving request.

### Chaupai 24
I have asked politely from my side. But they will never change from their side. You can feed crows with great love. But will they ever stop eating meat?

# Saints and Sinners Compared
The poet reflects on how good and bad exist side by side in this world.

### Chaupai 25
I bow to both saints and bad people. Both cause pain, but in different ways. The saint takes your heart when he leaves you. The bad person hurts you when you meet him.

### Chaupai 26
Both are born in this world together. But they are as different as a lotus and a leech. Both come from water. The lotus is beautiful to see and touch. The leech sticks to you and drinks your blood. Saints are like medicine that saves you. Bad people are like alcohol that confuses you. Both come from the same world.

### Chaupai 27
Good and bad people get good or bad names based on what they do. Think of nectar, moonlight, the holy river, and saints on one side. Think of poison, fire, dirty rivers, and hunters on the other side. Everyone knows which is which. But people like what they like.

### Doha 5
Good people take goodness. Low people take lowness. Nectar is praised because it gives life. Poison is praised because it kills.

### Chaupai 28
The sins of bad people and the goodness of saints are both like endless oceans. That is why I described some qualities and some faults. Without knowing the difference, you cannot choose what to keep and what to throw away.

### Chaupai 29
The creator god made both good and bad. The holy books separated them by looking at their qualities. All the old stories say the same thing: God's creation has both good and bad mixed together.

### Chaupai 30
Pain and pleasure. Sin and goodness. Day and night. Saint and sinner. High-born and low-born. Gods and demons. High and low. Nectar and poison. Good life and death. Illusion and truth. Soul and God. Luck and bad luck. Beggar and king. Holy cities and unholy cities. Pure rivers and impure rivers. Good places and bad places. Priests and butchers. Heaven and hell. Love and detachment. The holy books tell us the difference between all of these.

### Doha 6
God made this world of living and non-living things, mixing good and bad. But saints are like swans. A swan can drink milk and leave the water behind. Saints take the good and leave the bad.

### Chaupai 31
When God gives someone this swan-like wisdom, their mind leaves faults behind and loves only what is good. But even good people sometimes make mistakes because of time, habit, or past actions.

### Chaupai 32
But good people fix their mistakes. They destroy sorrow and sin and spread pure light. Bad people also sometimes do good when they find good company. But their dirty nature deep inside never really goes away.

### Chaupai 33
When the world sees someone dressed like a saint, they worship him because of the dress. But fakers get caught in the end. Their tricks don't last forever. Think of the old stories: One demon dressed as a healer to trick Hanuman, but Hanuman saw through him and killed him. The ten-headed king dressed as a holy man to kidnap Sita, but Rama destroyed him. Another demon sneaked into the line of gods to steal nectar, but the sun and moon spotted him, and Vishnu cut off his head. All fakers get exposed eventually.

### Chaupai 34
But even if a real saint wears torn clothes, he still gets respect. Think of Hanuman - just a monkey, but he leaped across the ocean, found Sita, burned down an entire city, and carried a mountain to save Rama's brother. Think of the old bear king - he looked rough and wild, but his wisdom helped win the war. Both were honored not for their appearance but for their hearts. Bad company brings harm. Good company brings help. Everyone knows this. The books say it. Life proves it.

### Chaupai 35
Wind lifts dust up to the sky. Flowing water drags dust down into mud. Same dust, different company. Parrots in a saint's house say "Rama, Rama." Parrots in a bad person's house learn to curse.

### Chaupai 36
In bad company, smoke becomes black soot. In good company, that same smoke becomes beautiful ink for writing holy books. When smoke meets water, fire, and wind, it becomes clouds that bring rain and give life to the world.

### Doha 7a
Planets, medicines, water, wind, cloth - all of these become helpful or harmful based on the company they keep. Only smart people understand this.

### Doha 7b
Both halves of the month have equal light and darkness. But one is called bright and one is called dark. One makes the moon grow. One makes it shrink. So people gave one a good name and one a bad name.

# Bowing to All Creation
Tulsidas sees Rama in everything and everyone, and bows to all.

### Doha 7c
All beings in this world - those who think and those who don't - are filled with Rama. Knowing this, I bow to everyone with folded hands.

### Doha 7d
Gods, demons, humans, serpents, birds, ghosts, ancestors, heavenly singers, magical beings, night creatures - I bow to all of you. Please, everyone, be kind to me.

### Chaupai 37
There are 8.4 million types of life. Some are born from heat, some from eggs, some from seeds, some from wombs. They live in water, on land, in the sky. Knowing they are all filled with Sita and Rama, I bow to them with folded hands.

### Chaupai 38
Please know that I am your servant. You are all full of kindness. Please come together and, without any tricks, bless me. I don't trust my own brains or strength. That is why I bow to everyone.

# The Poet's Humility
Tulsidas admits he has no skill - only love for Rama. He asks for forgiveness in advance.

### Chaupai 39
I want to sing about Rama's greatness. But my brain is small and his story has no bottom. I can't find any way to do this. My mind and thoughts are beggars. But my wish is like a king.

### Chaupai 40
My ability is very low. My wish is very high. I want nectar, but I can't even get buttermilk. Good people will forgive my boldness. They will listen to my baby talk with love.

### Chaupai 41
When a baby speaks in broken words, the mother and father listen happily. But cruel, crooked, mean-minded people - those who love finding faults in others - they will laugh.

### Chaupai 42
Everyone likes their own poetry, whether it's good or bad. But people who feel happy hearing someone else's work - such people are rare in this world.

### Chaupai 43
Most people are like ponds and rivers. They only swell up when they get water for themselves. But the ocean is different. When the full moon rises, the ocean swells with joy to greet it. Someone with a heart like that - who grows bigger seeing others shine - such a person is hard to find.

### Doha 8
My luck is small. My wish is big. But I believe one thing: Good people will be happy hearing this. Bad people will mock.

### Chaupai 44
But even their mocking will help me. Crows always call the sweet cuckoo "harsh." Herons laugh at swans. Frogs mock the rain-bird, who waits only for pure raindrops and won't drink from ponds. Dirty people always laugh at what is clean.

### Chaupai 45
People who don't love poetry and don't love Rama's feet - this story will taste flat to them. But people who love Vishnu and Shiva, whose minds are not twisted - they will find Rama's story sweet.

### Chaupai 46
Good people will know this story is decorated with love for Rama. They will praise it with kind words. I am not a poet. I am not good with words. I have no skills. I have no learning.

### Chaupai 47
There are so many types of words, meanings, decorations, rhythms, styles, moods, feelings, and rules about good and bad poetry.

### Chaupai 48
I don't know even one of these things. I write this on clean paper and say it honestly.

### Doha 9
My writing has no skill at all. But it has one quality that the whole world knows. Smart people with clear minds will listen because of that one thing.

# The Glory of Rama's Name
The one thing that makes this work precious - it contains Rama's name.

### Chaupai 49
This work has Rama's name in it. That name is very pure. It is the heart of all holy books. It is the home of all blessings. It removes all bad luck. Shiva himself keeps repeating it with Parvati.

### Chaupai 50
Even the most amazing poem by the best poet loses its shine without Rama's name. A beautiful woman dressed perfectly still looks incomplete without her clothes.

### Chaupai 51
On the other hand, even a bad poem by a poor poet, if it has Rama's name in it, is spoken and heard with respect by wise people. Saints are like bees. They take only the sweet part.

### Chaupai 52
My work has no poetic beauty at all. But Rama's glory shines in it. That is my only hope. Who has not become great through good company?

### Chaupai 53
Even smoke loses its bitterness when it meets sweet-smelling wood. My poetry is rough. But it describes something beautiful - Rama's story that blesses the world.

### Chhanda
Tulsidas says: This story of Rama brings blessings. It washes away the dirt of this dark age. My poor poetry flows crookedly like a river. But like the holy Ganga, its water is pure. Because it carries Rama's good name, this rough work will become beautiful and pleasing to good hearts. Even ash from a burning ground becomes lovely when it touches Shiva's body.

### Doha 10a
Because of Rama's glory, my poetry will become dear to all. Any tree that grows on the sandalwood mountain soaks up the fragrance and becomes precious. Then who cares that it's just wood?

### Doha 10b
A black cow's milk is still white and healthy. Knowing this, everyone drinks it. In the same way, though my language is rough, wise people happily sing and hear the glory of Sita and Rama.
